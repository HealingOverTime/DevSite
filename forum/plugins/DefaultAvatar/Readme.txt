This plugin is based on vanillicon plugin 

This plugin adds a custom avatar if they have not uploaded one. It will add it in the Profile as well as in the discussion and comments. It will not add it to online now because it does not create a thumbnail.

Add the url to the image you want to be the avatar in the settings page for the plugin.

Thanks to Tama for the settings page code
