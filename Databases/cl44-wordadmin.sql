It&#8217;s a clean, mobile-first, blog-focused theme designed through simplicity.</li>\n<li>A new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/11/11/focus-v2-demo-video/\">distraction-free writing mode for the editor</a>.

The company recently acquired $120 million to fund further growth and is now valued at $1.1 billion dollars.</p>\n<p>While Slack helps teams get things done together, much of the actual work happens outside of the app. That&#8217;s why the <a href=\"https://api.slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack API</a> offers the ability to add new <a href=\"https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook\" target=\"_blank\">Incoming WebHooks</a> to integrate outside services. With WordPress powering 23%+ of the world&#8217;s websites, it&#8217;s important to have an easy way to bring in notices from those sites.</p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress installations have the option of using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/slack/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack plugin</a>, created by <a href=\"http://gedex.web.id/\" target=\"_blank\">Akeda Bagus</a>, a developer with X-team. Last week we featured the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/bbpress-slack-integration-send-new-topics-and-replies-to-a-slack-channel\" target=\"_blank\">bbPress Slack Integration</a> plugin, which allows you to send notifications of new bbPress topics and replies to your Slack channel of choice. WP Slack performs a similar function for general WordPress events.</p>\n<p>The plugin is capable of notifying Slack, based on a few basic events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a post needs review (status transitioned to &#8216;pending&#8217;)</li>\n<li>When a post is published</li>\n<li>When there&#8217;s a new comment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, it includes a <code>slack_get_events</code> filter for adding more events. The <a href=\"http://gedex.web.id/wp-slack/\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> provides an example of creating a new event that will notify Slack when a user is logged in:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">add_filter( \'slack_get_events\', function( $events ) {\n    $events[\'user_login\'] = array(\n        \'action\'      =&gt; \'wp_login\',\n        \'description\' =&gt; __( \'When user logged in\', \'slack\' ),\n        \'message\'     =&gt; function( $user_login ) {\n            return sprintf( \'%s is logged in\', $user_login );\n        }\n    );\n\n    return $events;\n} );</pre>\n<p>Configuration inside the WordPress admin is simple. Once you&#8217;ve set up the webhook with Slack, you simply paste it into the Service URL field when setting up an integration:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slack-integration.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33712]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slack-integration.png?resize=843%2C524\" alt=\"slack-integration\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33756\" /></a></p>\n<p>WP Slack allows you to set up multiple integrations so you can send notices to different channels. Notices can also be temporarily deactivated and turned back on a later time. When you finish setting up an integration, the plugin allows you to fire off a test notification to ensure that it&#8217;s working correctly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/channel-notification.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33712]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/channel-notification.png?resize=843%2C227\" alt=\"channel-notification\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33758\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bagus has also developed a suite of free extensions that notify Slack based on events triggered by other plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-edd\" target=\"_blank\">Slack EDD</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-woocommerce\" target=\"_blank\">Slack WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-contact-form-7\" target=\"_blank\">Slack Contact Form 7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-gravityforms\" target=\"_blank\">Slack Gravity Forms</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These plugins make it possible to keep your team notified of new orders on a WooCommerce or EDD-powered store, or even website inquiries from your site&#8217;s contact form. Each extension requires the Slack plugin to be installed first.</p>\n<p>While the plugin author hasn&#8217;t announced plans to add this feature, it might be useful to have support for <a href=\"https://my.slack.com/services/new/outgoing-webhook\" target=\"_blank\">Outgoing Webhooks</a> as well.

John Blackbourn announced the beta and outlined a list of features and improvements that you&#8217;ll want to put through the paces. The most visible items include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new Twenty Fifteen default theme</li>\n<li>New distraction-free writing mode for the editor, enabled by default for beta</li>\n<li>The ability to automatically install new language packs right from the General Settings screen (available as long as your site&#8217;s file system is writable).</li>\n<li>A new inline formatting toolbar for images embedded into posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The items listed do not include everything that&#8217;s coming in 4.1, but rather the features that require the most testing before the official release. There are also many improvements under the hood for developers to test:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/20/update-on-query-improvements-in-4-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Improvements to meta, date, comment, and taxonomy queries</a>, including complex (nested, multiple relation) queries; and querying comment types</li>\n<li>A single term shared across multiple taxonomies is now split into two when updated.</li>\n<li>A new and better way for themes to handle <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-to-introduce-theme-support-for-the-title-tag\" target=\"_blank\">title tags</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/27/toward-a-complete-javascript-api-for-the-customizer/\" target=\"_blank\">Improvements to the Customizer API</a>, including contextual panels and sections, and JavaScript templates for controls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/focus-project-and-session-ui-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-1\" target=\"_blank\">Focus project (the new DFW) was merged into core along with the user session UI</a>. So far, reaction to the new distraction-free writing mode has been mixed, with the most vocal feedback coming from those who are not looking forward to turning the feature off on multiple sites. WordPress core contributors will be gathering feedback during the beta period in order to determine whether or not the new DFW mode will be shipped as &#8220;on&#8221; by default. Having it off by default decreases users&#8217; ability to discover the new DFW mode, but it would also help it to be more universally well-received.</p>\n<p>If you want to jump in and help test 4.1 beta 1 with all its exciting improvements, the easiest way is to get hooked up with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin.

Masonry was started as a collaboration project between WordPress theme designer <a href=\"http://uzelac.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Emil Uzelac</a> and <a href=\"http://devrix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DeviX</a>, a development company founded by Mario Peshev and Stanko Metodiev.</p>\n<p>Uzelac is most well-known for his work on the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-wordpress-theme-reviewer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org Theme Review Team</a> and his popular free <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive\" target=\"_blank\">Responsive theme</a> that was eventually <a href=\"http://mattreport.com/trent-lapinski-cyberchimps/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by CyberChimps</a>. He put out a tweet, announcing his availability:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>You have a WordPress project and I have 2 weeks free, let’s talk! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash\">#WordPress</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Emil Uzelac (@emiluzelac) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emiluzelac/status/508451598620979200\">September 7, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Uzelac was Peshev&#8217;s mentor for the Theme Review Team in 2011 before he promoted him to a reviewer. This was back in the days when you had to pass more than a dozen test reviews before moving on. &#8220;Emil is super dedicated to the WPTRT and a great person and should not be left unemployed at any time,&#8221; Peshev said. He responded to his tweet, and a theme collaboration was born.</p>\n<p>DevriX set out some ideas for the theme and then hired Uzelac to design and develop it. &#8220;We have added several things and will keep maintaining it, but we paid him for a full zip file that was (almost) ready to go on WordPress.org,&#8221; Peshev said. &#8220;Since he&#8217;s one of the TRT admins, it was the easiest way to cover the hundreds of requirements there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Peshev said that DevriX gets no practical business benefit from the theme, as the company doesn&#8217;t perform customization or installation services. He saw it as a good way to give back to the community while also helping volunteers to find more work for their expertise.</p>\n<h3>Making the Theme Review Team More Visible</h3>\n<p>As a result of this collaboration experience, Peshev discovered that there is no easy way for people to find and hire those who are skilled at preparing a theme for approval on WordPress.org. He suggested that a directory of Theme Review team members might be a good idea for promoting the folks who have  these abilities.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is no clear way to hire any of them for theme reviews or building a theme following the WordPress.org guidelines. I assume that small and medium agencies would be willing to pay for professional reviews or getting themes built for any reason, which would support both parties. I&#8217;ve had several clients paying for code reviews and fixing themes in order to get them in the WordPress.org Theme Directory.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the past, themes have sometimes taken months to go through the process, after getting rejected a few times and then finally gaining approval. Hiring someone to help prepare a theme to pass WordPress.org guidelines can save a company a good chunk of time. <strong>&#8220;Given the 4-6 week period to get a theme reviewed, that&#8217;s a valuable service,&#8221;</strong> Peshev said.</p>\n<p>A directory would help people in the community to be able to identify the qualified Theme Review Team volunteers available to hire for code review, even for products that are marketed outside of WordPress.org. &#8220;Same goes for all the other teams that don&#8217;t get props in the Core releases, such as docs, polyglots and accessibility&#8221; Peshev said. &#8220;In this case, theme reviewers are not listed anywhere and not publicly available for hire (for new themes or professional reviews).&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the case of Uzelac and Peshev&#8217;s collaboration, the end result is a nice free theme for the community to enjoy. With all the volunteer hours put into reviewing themes for WordPress.org, do you think reviewers could benefit from being listed in a directory? Or would this needlessly complicate the relationship between reviewers and submissions on WordPress.org?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 22:09:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: Flynn O’Connor on Organizing and Marketing a WordCamp for Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33505\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://wptavern.com/flynn-oconnor-on-organizing-and-marketing-a-wordcamp-for-developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7717:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WordCampVancouver2014FeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33505]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33641\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WordCampVancouver2014FeaturedImage.png?resize=680%2C296\" alt=\"WordCamp Vancouver Featured Image\" /></a></p>\n<p>One topic to come out of the discussion surrounding the <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/loopconf-sparks-controversy-with-tickets-priced-at-800\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/loopconf-sparks-controversy-with-tickets-priced-at-800\">cost to attend LoopConf</a> is the idea that WordCamps can&#8217;t be developer focused.

WordPress developers and designers interested in learning about practical, applied WordPress development by industry leaders and local WordPress practitioners attended the event.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Flynn O&#8217;Connor co-organized <a title=\"http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/\" href=\"http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Vancouver, BC Developer Edition</a>. It was a one day event <a title=\"http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/sessions/\" href=\"http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/sessions/\">filled with WordPress developer topics</a> including, an introduction to the command line, advanced custom fields, and getting started with unit tests. I interviewed O&#8217;Connor to find out how he marketed the event and what he did to achieve a relevant audience.</p>\n<h2>Interview With Flynn O&#8217;Connor</h2>\n<p><strong>At what point did you realize you needed to have a Developer Edition of WordCamp Vancouver?</strong></p>\n<p>This is something that our team discussed after the previous year&#8217;s WordCamp completed. There was a desire to not only create a camp for WordPress developers but also a WordPress focused event that would be of interest to the larger tech community within Vancouver to see what WordPress could do. While attending other events like <a title=\"http://2014.cascadiajs.com/\" href=\"http://2014.cascadiajs.com/\">CascadiaJS</a> conference, I found myself correcting a lot of people&#8217;s old pre-conceived notions of what WordPress is and can do now.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you market WordCamp Vancouver Developer Edition so that a majority of the attendees are developer or designer oriented?</strong></p>\n<p>We tried to be clear with our content that this event was going to focus on building with WordPress and not necessarily about end user topics. In emails, on the website, social media and in community posts like the one <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-vancouver-to-hold-developer-edition-in-july\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-vancouver-to-hold-developer-edition-in-july\">WPTavern published</a> about our event we tried to get the message out that if you can or wanted to know how to build on WordPress, this would be an event for you.</p>\n<p>We also connected with other tech related meet up groups and asked for the assistance in getting the word out about our event and reached out to several schools that offered web development programs and offered their students discount tickets. Even so, there are some people who are going to attend because they&#8217;re aware of WordPress and want to see what it&#8217;s all about but don&#8217;t know how to design or develop for it. From our experience, we&#8217;ve found you can&#8217;t really stop that.</p>\n<p><strong>What type of feedback did you get after the event? Did some attendees complain that the content was over their head?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, we did get some people who said some of the talks were advanced for them. But from the ones I talked to that brought this up, quite of a few of them were not discouraged by this. We can’t cater to everyone and make everyone happy but if we provide our attendees content that will challenge them, then hopefully, we are encouraging them to learn more and helping them to become better developers.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice can you give to organizers who want to put on a developer focused WordCamp?</strong></p>\n<p>Reach out to the tech community beyond WordPress, not only for attendees but also speakers. Many of them will be happy to help. Don’t be afraid of the content being too advanced for some attendees but try to balance out the talks so that less experienced developers don’t feel overwhelmed the entire time.</p>\n<p>Talk to meet up and smaller local event planners to get a sense for your community&#8217;s general skill level so you can better anticipate likely attendance levels for the more advanced talks. I am one of the co-organizers for the Vancouver meet up and I focus on the dev branch, so I had a decent idea of how many high level developers in our community would actually attend these events.</p>\n<h2>Understanding The Needs Of The Local Community</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LocalImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33505]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33651\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LocalImage.png?resize=640%2C126\" alt=\"Local Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/arimoore/1232161364/\">arimoore</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>Organizers are <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2013/08/20/organizing-a-non-wordcamp/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2013/08/20/organizing-a-non-wordcamp/\">encouraged to experiment</a> and break from the mold while still following the guidelines. WordCamp Vancouver Developer Edition proves it&#8217;s possible and if you look at <a title=\"http://i0.wp.com/2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/files/2014/07/WordCamp-Vancouver-2014-Public-Budget-Sheet11.png\" href=\"http://i0.wp.com/2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/files/2014/07/WordCamp-Vancouver-2014-Public-Budget-Sheet11.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33505]\">their budget sheet</a>, it cost just over $18,000. So not only can organizers create a WordPress developer centric event using the WordCamp branding, the financial support of doing so makes it much more affordable.</p>\n<p>One of the keys to the success of WordCamp Vancouver for developers and designers is understanding the needs of the local WordPress community. If there is sufficient demand and the community is large enough, consider organizing an event in your area. There&#8217;s also no rules in the guidelines that limit the amount of WordCamps per year in a given city. This means organizers can continue to have traditional WordCamps while organizing a separate event catered to developers.</p>\n<p>I want to know from those who have organized 500-1,000 person WordCamps if you plan to branch out and create smaller, niche events while using the WordCamp branding? If so, please let us know in the comments. Also feel free to share concerns, ideas, or ask questions related to organizing a niche event.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 20:33:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 170 – I’ve Got Your Drama Right Here\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://wptavern.com?p=33629&preview_id=33629\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-170-ive-got-your-drama-right-here\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3719:\"<p>Since our guest couldn&#8217;t make it due to illness, <a title=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\" href=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\">Marcus Couch</a> and I took the opportunity to thank all of the wonderful listeners who responded to our call to action in <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-169-wordpress-is-now-a-verb\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-169-wordpress-is-now-a-verb\">episode 169</a>.

While your standard blog might only have a handful of categories, more content-heavy sites can include hundreds of terms within custom taxonomies.</p>\n<p>Scrolling through an impossibly long list of categories or terms can be a clunky experience in the post editor. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-filter/\" target=\"_blank\">Taxonomy Filter</a> is a new solution for this, created by Andrea Landonio, a software engineer at Condé Nast in Milan.</p>\n<p>The plugin allows users to filter hierarchical term taxonomies inside the WordPress admin. Specifically, it adds a custom input field for filtering taxonomies when a user is assigning them in the post editor. Here&#8217;s an example with the default category taxonomy:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/category-filter.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33566]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/category-filter.jpg?resize=282%2C357\" alt=\"category-filter\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33578\" /></a></p>\n<p>Categories are automatically narrowed down as you type, so that you can easily locate the one you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/category-filtering.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33566]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/category-filtering.jpg?resize=282%2C279\" alt=\"category-filtering\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33579\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Taxonomy Filter plugin has a settings page that allows you configure which taxonomies you want to make filterable. Currently, it only works with hierarchical taxonomies, including default categories and <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies\" target=\"_blank\">custom taxonomies</a>. (It does not support non-hierarchical tags.)</p>\n<p>The settings page gives you two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable on post management pages (allow you to turn on/off filter field)</li>\n<li>Hide filter field if taxonomy is empty</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I tested the plugin and found that it works as advertised to quickly filter taxonomies. One added benefit is that it&#8217;s likely to keep users from impatiently creating new categories when they overlook an existing category due to too much scrolling. The instinct is to just create a new one which may have a similar name to one that already exists. This further bloats the list and makes categories less effective for grouping content.</p>\n<p>Installing the Taxonomy Filter plugin is one small way that you can make assigning a taxonomy a little more convenient and less clunky in the admin. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-filter/\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a> it for free from WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 20:55:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Lorelle on WP: WordPress Vancouver Social Meetup Sunday, Nov 16\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=12005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2014/11/13/wordpress-vancouver-social-meetup-sunday-nov-16/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:474:\"The next WordPress Social Meetup in Vancouver, Washington, is this Sunday, November 16 at 4-7PM.

Last week Jeff Chandler explored <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-the-focus-project-plans-to-enhance-distraction-free-writing-in-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">how the Focus Project plans to enhance distraction-free writing</a> in WordPress. If you haven&#8217;t been following the project, it&#8217;s essentially a complete re-think of the way WordPress has approached the DFW feature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dfw.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33514]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dfw.jpg?resize=417%2C395\" alt=\"dfw\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-33545\" /></a>Mark Jaquith posted a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/11/11/focus-v2-demo-video/\" target=\"_blank\">demo video</a> of the feature earlier this week when proposing it to be <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29806\" target=\"_blank\">merged into core</a> for 4.1. If you haven&#8217;t tested it yet, this video gives you a good idea of how the feature will work.</p>\n<p>In general, WordPress users have found distraction-free writing to be a valuable experience but are dissatisfied with the disconnect of being separated from the rest of the publishing tools in the editor. The Focus Project minimizes the transition, automatically fading the non-essential parts of the editor when you start typing. It keeps the the publishing tools just a mouse swipe away.</p>\n<p>The old DFW button is now changed to be a disabling toggle. For the 4.1 beta, this new feature will be automatically on, and WordPress core contributors will use this time to gather feedback and decide whether or not it should be on or off by default. If left on by default, it will be the most visible new feature in 4.1, since it impacts anyone who uses the content editor.</p>\n<h3>Session UI Approved to Merge Into Core</h3>\n<p>The second item approved for merge into 4.1 is the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30264\" target=\"_blank\">user session UI</a>, which is essentially a button that displays when a user has more than one active session. When clicked, the button will log the user out of all other sessions.</p>\n<p>During today&#8217;s core development chat, Blackbourn also outlined plans for the putting the session UI feature on track for future improvements. &#8220;We&#8217;ll use the <a href=\"https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-session-manager\" target=\"_blank\">session UI repo on GitHub</a> for future iterations (and we&#8217;ll do it as a proper feature plugin too if necessary),&#8221; he said. &#8220;Or it might just not be developed any further.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also clarified that planned improvements to extension installation and update screens will not make it into this release. &#8220;So unfortunately due to the work that some core folks have been doing on 4.0.1, the improvements that were slated for the plugin and theme install (and update) screens has not progressed past mockups, so that has been shelved for 4.1,&#8221; Blackbourn said.</p>\n<h3>Shared Terms Will be Split in WordPress 4.1</h3>\n<p>Under the hood, developers can look forward to progress on the taxonomy roadmap. Boone Gorges has made <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/11/12/an-update-on-the-taxonomy-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\">huge strides in fixing issues with shared terms</a>. Unraveling this knot was an extraordinary feat, not unlike navigating through a minefield, when it comes to backwards compatibility.</p>\n<p>As of 4.1, updating a shared term will cause it to be split into two separate terms. This solves a common problem where you update a term and have the others changed unintentionally. It also paves the way for more exciting improvements to taxonomy meta and post relationships, as Andrew Nacin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/\" target=\"_blank\">outlined</a> last year.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/twenty-fifteen-officially-added-to-the-development-version-of-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty Fifteen default theme</a> should also ship in this release, ready just in time for the new year. Blackbourn and contributors are aiming to have WordPress 4.1 beta 1 available Thursday around lunchtime GMT. The official release is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-1-project-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">scheduled</a> for the week of December 8th.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 00:28:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: bbPress Slack Integration: Send New Topics and Replies to a Slack Channel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33359\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://wptavern.com/bbpress-slack-integration-send-new-topics-and-replies-to-a-slack-channel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3290:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slack-logo.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33359]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slack-logo.jpg?resize=700%2C314\" alt=\"slack-logo\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33466\" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress recently adopted <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a> as its primary communication tool for contributor teams, largely replacing IRC. When trac tickets are mentioned in Slack, they are automatically linked up, which helps contributors reference and connect discussions. So far, the app has been enthusiastically received, especially since it offers a far more mobile-friendly option for asynchronous communication.</p>\n<p>WordPress-related projects outside of core have also started using Slack for team collaboration. Contributors to the <a href=\"http://pods.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Pods Framework</a> are finding Slack to be instrumental for staying connected. That&#8217;s why <a href=\"http://joshpress.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Pollock</a>, community manager for the project, created <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress-slack-integration/\" target=\"_blank\">bbPress Slack Integration</a>. This new plugin allows you to send notifications of new bbPress topics and replies to your Slack channel of choice.</p>\n<h3>Staying on Top of Support Requests</h3>\n<p>The Pods team already had GitHub and Asana integrations with their channels. These were working well, but they were missing updates from their bbPress-powered <a href=\"http://pods.io/forums\" target=\"_blank\">support forums</a> in the team&#8217;s support channel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The external integrations help keep us aware of what’s happening, while we’re working,&#8221; Pollock said. &#8220;This plugin does the same thing for support requests and makes us more responsive when we are in &#8216;Pods Mode.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>The bbPress Slack Integration plugin uses the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/HTTP_API\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress HTTP API</a> and a Slack webhook to send notifications from the forum where it is installed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bbpress-slack.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33359]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bbpress-slack.png?resize=607%2C108\" alt=\"bbpress-slack\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33501\" /></a></p>\n<p>In order to use the plugin with your own bbPress forums, you&#8217;ll first need to add a new Slack webhook by visiting:</p>\n<p><code>https://your-team-name.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook</code></p>\n<p>Set a channel to receive the notifications, copy the URL for the webhook, and paste it into the plugin&#8217;s settings page (Settings->bbPress Slack).

I am not the most tech savvy person in the world, but WordPress has provided me with the ability to make a great living, doing work I love to do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Learning and working with WordPress affords him the opportunity to travel and meet amazing people in the community. When asked by veterans if they can make a living in web technology using WordPress, Dalman responds, &#8220;I tell them if I can do it, they certainly can!&#8221; Some of the veterans taking advantage of Happy Joe are homeless or in deep financial trouble but are using WordPress to make a better life for themselves. Dalman notes that success stories of members will soon be shared on the Happy Joe website.</p>\n<h2>Happy Joe Needs Your Financial Support</h2>\n<p>While spreading the word about Happy Joe is appreciated, Dalman says the organization first and foremost needs financial assistance. &#8220;We need people to help fund the training and mentoring of our veterans. We have a lot of people who are sharing the story and mission of Happy Joe and we are <strong>VERY</strong> appreciative of that. However, we need sponsorships and donations to make a true difference.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Happy Joe is working with around a dozen veterans with more on the way. According to Dalman, there are a half-dozen companies willing and ready to hire veterans. However, the organization can&#8217;t make it happen without funding. &#8220;There is work that we need to do to get veterans up to speed and ready. This takes time, money, and commitment. So please, go and <a title=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/donate/\" href=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/donate/\">donate</a> to Happy Joe today so that we <strong>ALL</strong> can make a difference.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HappyJoeCorporateSponsorLevels.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33365]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33472\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HappyJoeCorporateSponsorLevels.png?resize=1025%2C83\" alt=\"Happy Joe Corporate Sponsor Levels\" /></a>Happy Joe Corporate Sponsor Levels\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in contributing financial support to the Happy Joe project, you can do so via the <a title=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/donate/\" href=\"https://www.happyjoe.org/donate/\">donations page</a>. Keep in mind that it&#8217;s a 501c3 non-profit organization meaning <strong>donations are tax-deductible</strong>. 100% of public donations and contributions go directly to helping the veterans Happy Joe works with.

Although you can edit text widgets in the customizer, it&#8217;s a boring experience and requires HTML knowledge to format text. Note enables you to add and edit content live from within the widget similar to a frontend editor.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NoteWidgetinAction2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33400]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33442\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NoteWidgetinAction2.png?resize=990%2C390\" alt=\"Note Widget in Action\" /></a>Note Widget in Action\n<p>From within the customizer, you can add a Title, apply a CSS class, or click the button which is like a shortcut to edit the widget&#8217;s content. One thing I noticed immediately is that applying a title doesn&#8217;t match the behavior of other widgets in WordPress. As you can see in the screenshot, the widget title doesn&#8217;t inherit the same style as the others. According to Matt Medeiros of Slocum Studio, this behavior is intentional.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We wanted the writing experience to be as pure as possible when using Note. We decided to omit displaying widget titles as part of that experience in the first version, but plan to revisit that in an upcoming release.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It may be intentional, but it gives me a sense that either the widget or my theme is broken. At its most basic level, Note should function the same way as a default text widget. Hopefully in a future version, the team will change the behavior to match that of a regular widget with an option to show or hide the title.</p>\n<p>Not only can you edit the widget&#8217;s content without visiting the backend, you can do it in style. Simply highlight text within the widget and a toolbar shows up allowing you to format the text. Note has a <strong>What You See Is What You Get</strong> interface. This is convenient since you no longer have to edit content, click save and publish, then refresh the page to see the changes.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NotesToolbar.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33400]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33443\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NotesToolbar.png?resize=598%2C117\" alt=\"Note Toolbar\" /></a>Note Toolbar\n<p>One feature missing from Note is the ability to add media, but Medeiros confirmed it will be added in a future release. While testing Note, I encountered a bug that added a / to every word that has an apostrophe. For example, I&#8217;ve turned into I/&#8217;ve. The bug presents itself when the customizer is open and a page refresh occurs. The team is aware of the bug and is working on a fix.</p>\n<p>Overall, I like what I see from Note. Once a few bugs are squashed and the ability to display the widget title is added, it will be a great replacement for the default Text widget. Note is <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/note/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/note/\">available for free</a> on the WordPress plugin directory. You can also follow development of Note <a title=\"https://github.com/sdsweb/note/\" href=\"https://github.com/sdsweb/note/\">on Github</a> where you can also file bug reports and contribute patches.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 22:44:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: Shortcake: A UI for WordPress Shortcodes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33308\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"http://wptavern.com/shortcake-a-ui-for-wordpress-shortcodes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3172:\"<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shortcake.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33308]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shortcake.jpg?resize=1024%2C502\" alt=\"photo credit: kendiala - cc\" class=\"size-full wp-image-33434\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kendiala/97929388/\">kendiala</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API\" target=\"_blank\">Shortcode API</a> was introduced in 2008 when <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 2.5</a> was released. Over the past six years, the UI for adding shortcodes has changed very little, despite the fact that they remain a big part of how many WordPress users structure complex content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake\" target=\"_blank\">Shortcake</a> is a new project created by the folks at <a href=\"http://next.fusion.net/2014/11/10/introducing-shortcake/\" target=\"_blank\">Fusion</a> with the aim of bringing new life to shortcodes. The plugin is aptly named, as it was designed to make shortcodes a piece of cake for users.</p>\n<p>Shortcake gives developers an easy way to register a UI for their shortcodes by utilizing 4.0&#8217;s <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/29178\" target=\"_blank\">changes to TinyMCE views</a>. Developers can use the Shortcake plugin alongside add_shortcode to create a user-friendly interface for adding shortcode content and attributes to pages/posts.</p>\n<p>The Fusion team provided a before and after example of editing a shortcode for a pullquote, with an <a href=\"https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcode-UI/blob/master/dev.php\" target=\"_blank\">example file</a> to show you how to use it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shortcake-example.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33308]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shortcake-example.png?resize=645%2C655\" alt=\"shortcake-example\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33427\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin currently supports the following input types: text, checkbox, textarea, radio, select, email, url, number, and date. The team behind it plans to improve it to support data sources and will also be publishing more documentation and example usages.</p>\n<p>The VIP team at Automattic liked the plugin so much that they have now made it available for all WordPress.com VIP customers, which is a testament to its quality. Fusion plans to present the project at the next <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Media-WordPress-Meetup/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Media &amp; Enterprise WordPress meetup</a> in New York.</p>\n<p>Gone are the days when you can afford to torture your users with complex shortcodes.

While WordPress core has many contributors who are sponsored by companies, the sister projects have yet to receive this kind of investment from the community.</p>\n<p>Jacoby is a longtime WordPress developer/contributor and the project lead on <a href=\"https://buddypress.org\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress</a> and <a href=\"http://bbpress.org\" target=\"_blank\">bbPress</a>. WordPress depends heavily on the continued maintenance and improvement of the sister projects and he believes that they can benefit from having a dedicated developer.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress is the plugin that powers the 16 million WordPress.org profiles, activity stream, and badge system. The WordPress.org support forums, along with the thousands of plugin and theme support forums, are all powered by bbPress. <a href=\"http://blog.glotpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GlotPress</a> is a BackPress-powered application that enabled WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress to be translated into different languages. Improvements to GlotPress are critical for WordPress&#8217; global mission to democratize publishing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">WordPress is more community than software, yet the software that powers the community has nobody working on it full time</span>,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;I want to change this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The campaign came about after developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miss_jwo\" target=\"_blank\">Jenny Wong</a> made the suggestion during events surrounding WordCamp San Francisco. Wong has been instrumental in organizing community contribution days and has a passion for bringing people together. <strong>&#8220;I think a lot more would be done if there are dedicated people all over the community,&#8221;</strong> she said.</p>\n<p>Jacoby had considered the idea before but didn&#8217;t think there would be enough people interested in supporting it. With the suggestion and support from Wong and others at WCSF, he decided to give it a try. &#8220;BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress came up so frequently, and I was pulled into so many discussions. I felt happy for how important those projects are to everyone, and sad that I haven’t found a way to truly dedicate myself to them,&#8221; Jacoby told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Near the end of the first day of the contributor summit, I was more emotional about it than I expected to be, and had a hard time translating that into words. Thankfully, Jen Mylo (who has always been super supportive to me) summed it up really nicely, and Jenny Wong followed up with the idea of raising money via Indiegogo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jacoby&#8217;s aim is to work on the projects &#8220;while remaining an independent and impartial entity with a dedicated period of distraction-free time.&#8221; Specifically, he plans to target the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Query and caching performance improvements to both BuddyPress and bbPress (to help them power the almost 20 million user profiles and the immense amount of activity going into them from all of the support forums)</li>\n<li>Media and Attachment support in BuddyPress</li>\n<li>Per-forum moderation in bbPress to help with plugin and theme moderation on WordPress.org.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Progress on the sister projects has been slow, since current contributions are all volunteer-driven from folks who have other obligations. Jacoby was originally reluctant to attempt a fundraising campaign but recognizes the necessity of having the money available for distraction-free work. If the goal is not met, he will prorate the funds and will work in a dedicated capacity on the projects for as long as the funds allow.</p>\n<p>Within the first few hours of launching the campaign, Jacoby has already surpassed 20% of the goal.

The conference is aimed at developers and organizers are planning for 700 &#8211; 1,000 attendees in Las Vegas on the weekend of May 7-8, 2015.</p>\n<p>A bit of controversy has surfaced regarding the ticket pricing, as LoopConf emerges as one of the most expensive WordPress-oriented conferences to date. With early bird tickets priced at $600 and regular tickets at $800, the combined sponsorship donations and estimated ticket sales have the potential to bring the total event budget just shy of a million dollars.</p>\n<p>Although events in this price range are not unheard of in the web industry, with many charging ticket prices in the thousands, WordPress-oriented conferences have traditionally been inexpensive. Because LoopConf is not endorsed by or affiliated with the WordPress Foundation, it doesn&#8217;t have to follow the <a href=\"http://plan.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a> set for WordCamps. Organizers of WP Foundation-sponsored events must <a href=\"http://plan.wordcamp.org/agreement-among-wordcamp-organizers-speakers-sponsors-and-volunteers/\" target=\"_blank\">agree</a> to make the event &#8220;accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of financial status.&#8221;</p>\n<p>LoopConf ticket pricing poses a stark contrast to traditional WordPress-oriented events, drawing sharp criticism for catering to an elite segment of developers, while pricing out the vast majority of others in the community.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loopconf\">@loopconf</a> tickets are $600 for early bird and $800 regular? Wow. Good luck with that.

The document helps to clarify what the organizers believe to be the value of the ticket price.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryandonsullivan\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Sullivan</a> set out to create a WordPress conference for developers, he had no idea that LoopConf would be pioneering a new segment of WordPress events. The organizing team, which includes a couple of experienced ng-conf organizers, was surprised to learn of the controversy surrounding the ticket pricing.</p>\n<p>Unlike a WordCamp, LoopConf is a for-profit endeavor and the team has no obligation to be financially transparent. &#8220;We won&#8217;t be publishing our budget,&#8221; Sullivan told the Tavern. &#8220;This is a for-profit endeavor but not to the degree most people think. Our margins are actually not very big, and basically cover our time and efforts for putting on the event itself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our number one goal is that everyone leaves feeling like it was a great investment, and if it ends up we risk a portion of our profits to make that a reality, then we&#8217;re fine with that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also doesn&#8217;t see any realistic way that the budget will reach a million dollars. &#8220;We are planning much more conservatively than that,&#8221; he said. What does he say to critics who believe the ticket prices to be exorbitant?</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ticket price is for the experience itself. Compared to other tech conferences outside of WordPress our prices are actually average or below average. I wish I had a way to illustrate how amazing this event will be without just having to say &#8220;this event is going to be amazing&#8221;, but that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at right now I suppose. From hack nights, to an amazing party, to swag, to meals, to a premier conference space at a secluded resort, we&#8217;re truly trying to deliver in every way we can. It&#8217;s going to be a fantastic place to learn and connect with friends and colleagues who have truly common interests.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The LoopConf team hopes to announce speakers by Wednesday of this week. Of the 28 speakers lined up, Sullivan estimates that 6 or 7 will be from outside the WordPress community, with the majority of others having spoken previously at other WordPress events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think is important to mention is that even if these speakers have spoken at WordCamps before, it&#8217;s not likely they&#8217;ve given talks like they&#8217;ll be giving at LoopConf,&#8221; he said. <strong>&#8220;With a very developer focused audience a lot of these presenters will be able to give talks that they&#8217;re really excited about, which creates a very unique energy and environment for higher learning.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>The conference structure is also very different from what one might expect of a WordCamp. LoopConf doesn&#8217;t have a team of volunteers supporting the event but instead utilizes a paid event coordinator to manage the majority of the logistics with the venue, vendors, sponsors, etc. Sullivan expects that he and the other organizers will have a few months of working 20-30 hours per week leading up to the event.</p>\n<p>Those who are unable to attend LoopConf can watch all sessions via a global live stream for free. Videos of the sessions will also be available within minutes after sessions are finished and will be offered for free to anyone who wants to learn from the event&#8217;s speakers.</p>\n<p>WordPress conferences that fall under the WordCamp name have traditionally been inexpensive events, designed to bring together a local community. Because Sullivan and his team are pioneering a different event structure, they have endured a healthy amount of criticism. The team&#8217;s goal to bring in top developers from the larger community would not be possible within the confines of a traditional WordCamp.</p>\n<p>Sullivan hopes that other conference organizers will also be inspired to break out of the box and host more unique events. &#8220;I would love to see more niche conferences that are WordPress specific. There are already great conferences out there like WooConf, Pressnomics, Prestige, and some others that I&#8217;m probably forgetting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If there&#8217;s an opportunity to get together for a good time and learn from each other in the process, count me in.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 22:32:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: Why WordPress Doesn’t Need to Fear Ghost, Yet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33282\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-doesnt-need-to-fear-ghost-yet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11555:\"<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NoNeedToFearGhostYetFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33294\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NoNeedToFearGhostYetFeaturedImage.png?resize=640%2C287\" alt=\"No Need To Fear Ghost Just Yet Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/blackzack00/12615597133/\">black.zack00</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>Mark Gibbs, who <a title=\"http://www.networkworld.com/author/Mark-Gibbs/\" href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/author/Mark-Gibbs/\">writes for NetworkWorld,</a> published an article on how <a title=\"https://ghost.org/\" href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a> may one day <a title=\"http://www.networkworld.com/article/2845372/software/ghost-could-scare-off-wordpress-from-the-top-of-the-blogging-platforms.html\" href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/article/2845372/software/ghost-could-scare-off-wordpress-from-the-top-of-the-blogging-platforms.html\">scare WordPress off</a> as the top publishing platform.

On the right is a live preview that shows how content will look when it&#8217;s published. This single editor is like the WordPress Visual and Text editors combined.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostContentEditor.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33283\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostContentEditor.png?resize=1025%2C303\" alt=\"It\'s Like a Visual and Text Editor in One!\" /></a>It&#8217;s Like a WordPress Visual and Text Editor in One!\n<p>The editor is so well liked, several plugins exist that bring it to WordPress. <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/gust-plugin-brings-the-ghost-admin-panel-into-wordpress\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/gust-plugin-brings-the-ghost-admin-panel-into-wordpress\">Gust</a>, <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/markpress-plugin-transforms-wordpress-into-a-markdown-powered-journal\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/markpress-plugin-transforms-wordpress-into-a-markdown-powered-journal\">MarkPress</a>, and <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/prettypress-plugin-reinvents-wordpress-post-editing-with-live-preview\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/prettypress-plugin-reinvents-wordpress-post-editing-with-live-preview\">PrettyPress</a> add a live preview pane to the WordPress post editor. Gibbs notes how the WordPress editor differs from Ghost, &#8220;In contrast to WordPress the &#8216;Visual&#8217; view in the editor is a simple interpretation of the HTML so you have to save and preview content to see how it’s really rendered by the currently selected theme.&#8221; While true, there is a simple way around this pitfall.</p>\n<p>WordPress supports the ability for theme developers to link a custom stylesheet to the TinyMCE visual editor. It&#8217;s called <a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_editor_style\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_editor_style\">editor-style.css</a> and unfortunately, not many theme developers take advantage of this nifty feature. The stylesheet enables the visual editor to take on the look and feel of the frontend of the site, delivering a <em>what you see is what you get</em> experience. <a title=\"http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer\" href=\"http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer\">Stargazer</a> by Justin Tadlock is an excellent example of how to use editor-style.css.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/StarGazerVisualEditorStyle.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33284\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/StarGazerVisualEditorStyle.png?resize=964%2C652\" alt=\"The Visual Editor in Stargazer by Justin Tadlock\" /></a>The Visual Editor in Stargazer by Justin Tadlock\n<p>Though the addition of editor-style.css doesn&#8217;t make the editor perfect, it vastly improves the writing experience. Having the content in the editor look the same as the final result is a huge convenience. Thanks to improved oEmbed previews <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-benny-now-available-for-download\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-benny-now-available-for-download\">in WordPress 4.0</a>, the Visual editor is the default view when I write content.</p>\n<p>The Text editor still has its use, especially when a snafu occurs in the Visual editor but I think in the future, the Visual editor will improve to the point that the choice between Text and Visual will disappear. In the decisions not options approach, there will be one editor to rule them all. Between the custom stylesheet and improvements to the visual editor, I believe the writing experience in WordPress is superior to Ghost.</p>\n<h2>The Ghost Dashboard</h2>\n<p>One of the other highly touted features of Ghost is its beautiful, <strong>non-existent</strong> dashboard. Gibbs notes that themes and the backend of Ghost are fully responsive. A note to Gibbs that the backend of WordPress is also fully responsive. The following image from the project&#8217;s <a title=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform\">Kickstarter page</a> was enough to convince some people to back the project.</p>\n<p>To this day, Ghost doesn&#8217;t have a dashboard <a title=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Planned-Features\" href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Planned-Features\">but it&#8217;s coming</a>. I admit, the concept images of the dashboard are pretty, colorful, and display information in squares instead of big rectangles. The question I have is whether the actual implementation will look anything like the screenshot.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostDashboard.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33285\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostDashboard.jpg?resize=700%2C481\" alt=\"The Ghost Dashboard as Seen on its Kickstarter Page\" /></a>The Ghost Dashboard as Seen on its Kickstarter Page\n<p>The WordPress Dashboard in comparison looks old but gives you the ability to arrange items the way you see fit. I&#8217;m not sure what can be done to make the dashboard <em>pretty</em>. With the eventual inclusion of the REST API to WordPress, we&#8217;ll likely see hundreds of different interpretations of not only the backend of WordPress, but the dashboard as well.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/TheWordPressDashboard.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33286\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/TheWordPressDashboard.png?resize=1025%2C471\" alt=\"The WordPress 4.0 Dashboard\" /></a>The WordPress 4.0 Dashboard\n<h2>The Third Party</h2>\n<p>Gibbs highlights the fact that the number of third-party themes for Ghost continues to increase. Meanwhile, there are those in the WordPress community who think themes have <a title=\"http://chriswallace.net/wordpress-themes-become-commodity/\" href=\"http://chriswallace.net/wordpress-themes-become-commodity/\">become a commodity</a>. With WordPress now over 10 years old, there are plenty of free and commercial themes to choose from.</p>\n<p>Ghost has a <a title=\"http://marketplace.ghost.org/\" href=\"http://marketplace.ghost.org/\">marketplace available</a> which lists free and commercial themes. The biggest difference between it and the <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/\">WordPress Theme Directory</a> is the inconsistent way of displaying and locating a theme. Ghost doesn&#8217;t have an official directory to host themes. Listing themes created by the community instead of hosting them takes away the ability to create a consistent user experience.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostThemeMarketplace.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33287\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GhostThemeMarketplace.png?resize=1025%2C705\" alt=\"The Ghost Theme Marketplace\" /></a>The Ghost Theme Marketplace\n<p>When browsing themes on the marketplace, each listing takes you to a theme&#8217;s Github page, a site using the theme, a 404 page, or somewhere else on the web. While most of the Github pages for Ghost themes display information in a consistent manner, I prefer the browsing experience on the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">WordPress Theme Directory</a>.</p>\n<p>With the WordPress Theme Directory, I trust what I&#8217;m downloading as the code has been vetted, especially if it&#8217;s a recent addition. Information containing the version number and the average rating is consistently in the same location. The preview link is an added bonus but previews need work as they don&#8217;t always accurately render a theme.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/TheWordPressThemeDirectory.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33282]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33288\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/TheWordPressThemeDirectory.png?resize=1025%2C889\" alt=\"The WordPress Theme Directory\" /></a>The WordPress Theme Directory\n<h2>Ghost is a Long Way From Scaring WordPress</h2>\n<p>Gibbs ends his article by saying, Ghost &#8220;has to be one of the most powerful and best engineered blogging platforms ever.&#8221; While I think the jury is still out on whether it&#8217;s the best engineered platform available, there is so much that goes into the success of an open source publishing system that it alone won&#8217;t propel the platform past WordPress. Ghost has the luxury of a fresh start and the opportunity to build a rock solid foundation for the platform&#8217;s future. However, it&#8217;s going to take more than that to knock WordPress off its pedestal.</p>\n<p>In its current form, Ghost satisfies an audience that wants a simple, frictionless, publishing experience. Ghost delivers but without a robust third-party ecosystem, I don&#8217;t see how it will ever reach the same plateau of WordPress. That&#8217;s not to say Ghost can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t be a successful project, it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t see it being used on 20% of the web.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s early and Ghost has a long way to go before it hits the pivotal 1.0 milestone. The items listed on the <a title=\"https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap\" href=\"https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap\">project&#8217;s roadmap</a> indicate a lot of cool features are on the way. But for now, Ghost doesn&#8217;t have or do anything that WordPress should be afraid of.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 19:21:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Matt: Onyx Communicator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44361\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"http://ma.tt/2014/11/onyx-communicator/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:453:\"<p>OnBeep, an <a href=\"http://audrey.co/\">Audrey</a> company, has <a href=\"http://www.onbeep.com/blog/2014/11/5/introducing-onyx\">introduced their first product, the Onyx</a>.

Beautiful Taxonomy Filters was created by Swedish plugin developer Jonathan de Jong at the <a href=\"https://www.tigerton.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Tigerton</a> web agency.

(If JavaScript is not supported it will fall back to the default select boxes.) Below is an example from my tests using the plugin with a standard portfolio custom post type:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/portfolio-filters.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33229]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/portfolio-filters.jpg?resize=680%2C202\" alt=\"portfolio-filters\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33249\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin is capable of including as many filters as you want to include.

This is because de Jong has not yet been able to create proper rewrite rules for the multiple filtering to work, due to the fact that they are handled differently by WordPress than other CPTs.

One thing to keep in mind is that although you can hide menus, clients can still access hidden sections if they know the URL. By hiding admin notices generated by plugins, you prevent clients from accessing potentially hidden pages.</p>\n<p>As part of the client dashboard, you can enable Sync Stylesheet. The Sync Stylesheet adds spacing to items in the admin menu and increases the font size making it easier to read.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SyncDashboardStyleSheet.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33212]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33222\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SyncDashboardStyleSheet.png?resize=469%2C481\" alt=\"Admin Menu with Sync Stylesheet Enabled\" /></a>Admin Menu with Sync Stylesheet Enabled\n<p>Despite WordPress&#8217; reputation as being easy to use, it can be intimidating to first time users.

It’s not that I don’t like using them, or that they’re junk (most are, but that’s a separate issue). No, the problem is that most people don’t have the foggiest idea how WordPress handles caching internally, and what causes their site to run faster.</p>\n<h3>Static page caching</h3>\n<p>Most caching plugins do what is called static page caching. They cache a complete page, including all of it’s HTML. This is terrific, as it means that WordPress doesn’t need to regenerate the page every time someone visits it, but it means that those pages will be out of date sometimes when content is updated. Anyone who has used these plugins can usually attest to cursing at their site due to to the cache not updating when required.</p>\n<h3>Object caching</h3>\n<p>For a very long time, WordPress has had a caching system baked into it. Most WordPress developers I’ve met have no idea this exists. Some have used transients, which are a part of the WordPress caching API, but in my experience, very few developers properly understand how they work.</p>\n<p>By default, WordPress includes an internal caching system. If you use <code>get_option( ‘something’ );</code> somewhere in your site, then run that same code later on in that page, WordPress will only need to load the data from the database once, as it caches it for use later on in the page load. It does this via the <code>wp_cache_add()</code>, <code>wp_cache_set()</code> and <code>wp_cache_get()</code> functions.</p>\n<p>Transients behave in a similar way, but by default can store the data for use in subsequent page views by storing them in the database. Storing information in the database is resource intensive though, so transients must be used sparingly to avoid hammering the database too hard and actually causing the site to slow down rather than speed up.</p>\n<p>What we need is the ability to store information in a persistent way (for use on more than the current page load), which can be written to and from extremely rapidly (unlike caching in the database).</p>\n<h3>Persistent object caching</h3>\n<p>Although the object caching system in WordPress was designed to only work on a single page load by default, the smart folks on the WordPress core team ensured that it was trivial to plug into this and provide a way to store data however you want and for as long as you want. Awesome!</p>\n<p>A normal WordPress plugin cannot be used to provide persistent object caching in WordPress. You need to manually create a drop-in file called object-cache.php, which sits in the wp-content folder. Some of the larger (bloated?) plugins, will automatically generate this drop-in file in your wp-content folder.</p>\n<p>Once installed, the object caching drop-in will cache anything utilizing the WordPress caching API. This includes transients, which will automatically stop using the default database layer and instead make use of whatever object caching back-end is available.</p>\n<p>Some of the earlier implementations of object-cache.php files for WordPress simply stored the data in the database, or in flat static files. But there are a multitude of better backends/places to store small pieces of data like this, and there are many different object caching drop-ins available for WordPress to hook into these various systems.</p>\n<h3>In-memory data stores – ninja fast data storage</h3>\n<p>MySQL is fast, but nothing compares to just throwing some data into RAM for maximum performance. With this in mind, many people who are much smarter than I, have developed systems for allowing us to store random bits of data in the server&#8217;s RAM. The most popular of these is Memcached, but there are others including APC and Redis which are very popular. Since they store their data in RAM (when possible) and are designed to be fast rather than reliable, they are insanely fast at both data storage and retrieval.</p>\n<p>With a database or flat file caching back-end, you can not refresh your cache rapidly, or store tiny bits of data. With an in-memory data store, those problems do not exist. For this reason, use of an in-memory data storage back-end can provide an enormous performance advantage to sites using them in conjunction with the WordPress object caching API.</p>\n<p>To make use of one of these, simply ensure that Redis, Memcached or APC are installed on your server, then install one of their corresponding drop-in files (you have to get the correct one or all hell will break loose).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Memcached – <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/memcached/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wordpress.org/plugins/memcached/</a></li>\n<li>Redis – <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/</a></li>\n<li>APC – <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/apc/\" target=\"_blank\">https://wordpress.org/plugins/apc/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have an appropriate object caching drop-in installed, you should notice an immediate increase in performance. WordPress caches a lot of data internally and none of that will need to be queried on every page load.</p>\n<p>It is entirely normal to see a stock WordPress installation go from 20+ MySQL queries per page down to 4 queries, as the object caching backend takes care of storing all of the data which does not change between page loads. The WordPress API always attempts to refresh the cache when required; there are some instances in which this does not work perfectly, but it is usually a flawless cache refreshing process.</p>\n<h3>Faster static page caching</h3>\n<p>There are ways to serve and refresh static page caching plugins via the WordPress object caching system too, including via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/batcache/\" target=\"_blank\">Batcache</a> plugin, provided by the kind folks at Automattic. This is beyond the scope of this blog post, but it is worth investigating if you also require static page caching.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Caching within WordPress is complex. Object caching is a vital tool for your toolbox, as it can provide a huge performance improvement without requiring you to resort to full page caching.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Nov 2014 19:54:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Adds Emoji Support, Coming Soon to Jetpack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33152\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-adds-emoji-support-coming-soon-to-jetpack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1951:\"<p>Twitter announced today that it has open sourced <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2014/open-sourcing-twitter-emoji-for-everyone\" target=\"_blank\">Twemoji</a>, a set of 872 emoji characters.

Its convenient toolbar gives you access to all your VMs with the ability to execute commands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vagrant-manager.gif\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33022]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vagrant-manager.gif?resize=940%2C523\" alt=\"vagrant-manager\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33144\" /></a></p>\n<p>Vagrant Manager&#8217;s primary features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Indicators for running/halted VM&#8217;s:</strong> on (green), off (red), suspended (orange)</li>\n<li><strong>Execute vagrant commands:</strong> hover over a VM and select a command from the dropdown</li>\n<li><strong>Customization options available through the preferences pane:</strong> set preferences for launch, how VMs are displayed, refresh interval, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Machine Support:</strong> run actions against one machine or all of them at once</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adding Vagrant Manager is actually much easier than setting up a new Vagrant configuration. After you download it, Vagrant Manager automatically detects VirtualBox and Parallels machines. Any vagrant machines that you want it to detect must already be initialized. If you don&#8217;t see a machine in the list, simply run <code>vagrant init</code> on it. Machines will disappear from your list once destroyed, so you might want to add a bookmark in Vagrant Manager for quick access later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vagrant-manager.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33022]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vagrant-manager.png?resize=1025%2C575\" alt=\"vagrant-manager\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33102\" /></a></p>\n<p>The preferences pane lets you select your Terminal preference, change the icon theme for the status bar, launch at login, and show/hide various counts/notifications.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/preferences.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33022]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/preferences.png?resize=900%2C953\" alt=\"preferences\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33151\" /></a></p>\n<p>Certainly, you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> a UI for managing your VMs, but it gives you a nice visual overview of all your machines in one centralized place. If you&#8217;re like me, and you constantly forget which machines you have running, this utility is a convenient addition to your menu bar.

The acquisition adds all six members of the company, including co-founders Simon Dickson and Simon Wheatley, to the WordPress.com VIP team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fairly natural transition for us,&#8221; Dickson told the Tavern. &#8220;We were part of Automattic&#8217;s VIP Featured Partner program from day one &#8211; so we&#8217;ve known a lot of these people for literally years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Code for the People (CFTP) began talking to Automattic in the spring of this year on a very informal basis, but once the team decided it was a realistic prospect, things started to speed up. In joining the VIP team, CFTP will say goodbye to their days of designing and developing websites.</p>\n<p>Dickson anticipates that they will be joining in with what the VIP team is already doing, except in European hours. &#8220;The team exists to provide expertise and products to support the world&#8217;s biggest publishers, whether that&#8217;s on WordPress.com or self-hosted systems,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>As new Automattic employees, the team will help to expand VIP&#8217;s reach into the European market. <strong>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking forward to bringing an additional perspective to the team, based on our own experiences on the front line, and in the European market,&#8221;</strong> Dickson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I&#8217;ll be looking for ways to help develop the European ecosystem. It was something we talked about in Sofia: a lot of WP agencies would like some kind of network, formal or informal, to share ideas and experiences. I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s something I can do as part of my new role.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The acquisition includes CFTP&#8217;s <a href=\"http://babbleplugin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Babble</a> plugin, an open source multilingual tool that Mullenweg counted as one of the key parts of the deal, according to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/automattic-buys-uks-code-for-the-people-to-build-out-its-wordpress-vip-enterprise-business/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a>. Babble will continue to be maintained by Automattic, the details of which are still being fleshed out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been really encouraged by the prominence of the multilingual question in recent weeks and months,&#8221; Dickson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an area where we know WordPress needs to do better; and it&#8217;s been great to see people recognizing Babble as, potentially, the most core-friendly way of answering it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Code for the People is a company that was built on the principle of giving back to open source platforms. with employees regularly contributing to WordPress core. At the end of September it was announced that CFTP developer <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead\" target=\"_blank\">John Blackbourn would be leading WordPress 4.1</a>, a commitment the company made long before the acquisition deal was sealed.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;We felt it was important for a small team, even as small as ours, to stand up and say yes &#8211; the future of WordPress is that important to us,&#8221;</strong> Dickson said. Blackbourn will continue leading the release as an Automattic employee.</p>\n<p>The founders of CFTP never set out to get acquired. &#8220;Genuinely, we formed Code For The People as a means to an end. We wanted to support each other’s efforts to do interesting things with WordPress, and to make WordPress better as a result,&#8221; Dickson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Building a successful business was a happy bi-product of that, but it was never the primary motivation. We chose the name Code For The People very deliberately. It was always there to keep us honest, and ensure we stayed true to our mission.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bittersweet day as CFTP bids goodbye to many of their clients and the brand they worked to build. Dickson hopes to bring that same dedication to VIP clients at Automattic with a focus on expanding its services in Europe.</p>\n<p>The Code for the People brand will be retired. If you check out the farewell message on the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://codeforthepeople.com\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, you&#8217;ll notice that it was built using <a href=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/ever-after/\" target=\"_blank\">Ever After</a>, a wedding theme by WordPress.com. Although the team is giving up the strong brand name they&#8217;ve created, they hope to carry on their shared love of open source software as employees of Automattic.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 19:22:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Matt: Acquiring Code For The People\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44359\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://ma.tt/2014/11/acquiring-code-for-the-people/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:496:\"<p>I spoke with <a href=\"http://about.me/tonyconrad\">Tony Conrad</a> and Laurie Segall at <a href=\"http://websummit.net/\">Web Summit in Dublin</a> today and was able to announce that Automattic has <a href=\"http://vip.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/code-for-the-people/\">acquired Code For The People to join our VIP team</a>. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/automattic-buys-uks-code-for-the-people-to-build-out-its-wordpress-vip-enterprise-business/\">Techcrunch also covered the news</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 17:06:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"Matt: Texas Landslide\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44357\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"http://ma.tt/2014/11/texas-landslide/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:392:\"<p>Mother Jones covers the results in Texas of the election in a harsh but fair way: <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/11/battleground-texas-greg-abbott-wendy-davis-flop\">Wendy Davis Spent $36 Million and All She Got Was This Lousy Landslide.

In a <a title=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/blog/updates/pricing-answers/\" href=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/blog/updates/pricing-answers/\">post on the official SIDEKICK blog</a>, Ben Fox explains that in the past two weeks, customers went through a pricing experiment with an opportunity to provide feedback. The feedback to SIDEKICK highlighted areas ripe for improvement including pricing, the number of plans, and determining value.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest lessons learned from the article is to base a price on value, not on cost.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our biggest mistake when we started discussing price was trying to determine what it would cost us to support our platform and each customer, not what the value of our platform was to our customers. When you price based on cost, you leave money on the table. When you price based on value, everybody wins.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy to see SIDEKICK stick by its instincts after receiving the following feedback, &#8220;SaaS has no place in WordPress” and “I will only ever pay a flat fee for a plugin.” If SIDEKICK restructured its plans to cater to this mindset, they&#8217;ll almost certainly go out of business. Fox points out three things that would happen if SIDEKICK accepted a one-time flat fee and unlimited updates.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We would never see a return on our investment and our customers would never see the value they’ve paid for</li>\n<li>The quality of our product would never really improve because we couldn’t afford to add new features or do much more than bug fix</li>\n<li>Our prices would go up exponentially because we would need to make sure we’re covering the lifetime COSTS of a customer. Not a smart way to do business.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s <a title=\"http://mattreport.com/pricing-wordpress-product/\" href=\"http://mattreport.com/pricing-wordpress-product/\">been said before</a> and bears repeating, &#8220;the days of low-priced plugins and unlimited everything are going by the way side.&#8221; WordPress product businesses that operate with unlimited anything are almost certain to fail as it&#8217;s an unsustainable model. Customers need to realize this sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>If pricing is something you&#8217;re having trouble with in your business, Chris Lema has written a series of posts you can read for free on the <a title=\"http://chrislema.com/tag/pricing/\" href=\"http://chrislema.com/tag/pricing/\">topic of pricing</a>. If you want something more in-depth, consider purchasing and reading <a title=\"http://chrislema.com/store/price-right-introduction-product-pricing/\" href=\"http://chrislema.com/store/price-right-introduction-product-pricing/\">The Price is Right</a> by Chris Lema. Matt Medeiros of <a title=\"http://mattreport.com/\" href=\"http://mattreport.com/\">MattReport.com</a> also has a lot of content on pricing and general business practices.</p>\n<p>I appreciate the transparency Fox offered regarding SIDEKICK&#8217;s pricing structure and the reasons behind it. It would be nice to see more companies share the lessons they&#8217;ve learned in the pricing game. By sharing knowledge, everyone in the WordPress ecosystem wins.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Nov 2014 02:45:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: 10up Open Sources Its Engineering Best Practices\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33026\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"http://wptavern.com/10up-open-sources-its-engineering-best-practices\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2796:\"<p>Taylor Lovett, director of Web Engineering at 10up, <a href=\"http://10up.com/blog/2014/engineering-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that the company is open sourcing its engineering best practices. <a href=\"http://10up.com/\" target=\"_blank\">10up</a> has historically been a leader in contributing to open platforms, most notably being one of the first development agencies to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/10up-sponsors-helen-hou-sandi-to-work-full-time-on-wordpress-core\" target=\"_blank\">sponsor an employee to work full-time on WordPress core</a>.</p>\n<p>The company used GitHub pages to create a <a href=\"http://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/\" target=\"_blank\">website featuring best practices</a> for tools, project structure, version control, PHP, and JavaScript.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10up-best-practices.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33026]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10up-best-practices.png?resize=1025%2C848\" alt=\"10up-best-practices\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33070\" /></a></p>\n<p>10up&#8217;s best practices were created in an effort to standardize the company&#8217;s tools, frameworks, libraries, style, version control, etc., for its employees. <strong>&#8220;Standardization in engineering is increasingly important with such a large team. Over the past few months we collaborated as a company to document how we engineer and why,&#8221;</strong> Lovett said. The result is a concise public reference for 10up&#8217;s 90+ full time employees and anyone else who is interested.</p>\n<p>This collection of best practices and tools makes it easier for new employees to jump on board and be ready for efficient collaboration with others in the company. The in-depth guide covers everything from efficient database queries, data storage, namespacing, and security, to helpful tools for local development, dependency management, and version control.</p>\n<p>Although the page&#8217;s description emphasizes that the content is not geared to teach anyone to become an engineer, the best practices site is undoubtedly a valuable learning resource. If you&#8217;re new to WordPress development, the site will give you an idea of the kinds of tools that a top agency uses in order to work more efficiently.</p>\n<p>The team at 10up hopes that the <a href=\"http://10up.github.io/Engineering-Best-Practices/\" target=\"_blank\">best practices website</a> will also help to influence community members.

Herbrandson does a good job of explaining the attacks without inundating the reader with technical jargon. He also links to WordPress items that are relevant to each type of attack.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve spoken to Herbrandson at a few different WordCamps and one question I&#8217;ve asked him is &#8220;what does this all mean to the average user?&#8221; He answers the question in his post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All software, old and new, follows the same concepts that made computers work decades prior to now. The only difference today is the number of complex layers that have been added to make the process seem confusing.</p>\n<p>The only ones confused though, are the people for whom the complexity was implemented to protect in the first place: <strong>the users</strong>. The continuous pattern of cyber-assault on everything from banks to bakeries, and across the board from Target to Apple, is showing that this world requires users to break the expectation of confusion and understand how Internet instigators are really coming after us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Herbrandson and others in the field have the difficult task of informing the public without scaring it. I&#8217;ve sat in sessions at WordCamps where he educates users on website security and most of the attendees realize they have to take website security seriously. There&#8217;s only been a few times where attendees have become scared, but it&#8217;s good to be scared.</p>\n<p>However, a poor reaction to being scared is to install several different security focused plugins thinking you&#8217;ll be protected from every threat. In most cases, this will end up doing more harm than good as plugins lock down potentially useful features such as XML-RPC. I&#8217;m all for securing websites, but I also believe in such a thing as <em>too much security</em>. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no such thing as a silver bullet to protect against every threat without being an inconvenience in some way.</p>\n<p>Definitely <a title=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/11/most-common-attacks-affecting-todays-websites.html\" href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/11/most-common-attacks-affecting-todays-websites.html\">check out his article</a> and consider the questions asked at the bottom of the post. If you&#8217;ve never seen Herbrandson present on WordPress security fundamentals, here is a recorded presentation from WordCamp Orange County 2014. In the session, he covers simple principles everyone can implement to keep the risk of attacks as low as possible.</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Nov 2014 22:46:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Bulk Deactivate: A New WordPress Plugin Debugging Tool\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33025\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://wptavern.com/bulk-deactivate-a-new-wordpress-plugin-debugging-tool\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3653:\"<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bulk-install.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33025]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19216\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bulk-install.jpg?resize=974%2C524\" alt=\"photo credit: -pdp- - cc\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/51553705@N00/8191743/\">-pdp-</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>Entry level WordPress debugging often involves the tedious task of turning plugins on and off to track down the culprit that is breaking something on your site. When seeking help in support forums, users are often instructed to deactivate all of their plugins and activate one of the default themes.</p>\n<p>This process can become especially complicated when you have, for example, 55 plugins active, 10 inactive, and 4 recently active. Trying to remember which ones were previously active/inactive is maddening, especially if you&#8217;re new to the site and not aware of where and how the plugins are in use.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Bulk Deactivate \" href=\"http://raison.co/bulk-deactivate/\" target=\"_blank\">Bulk Deactivate</a> is a new WordPress debugging tool that offers advanced options for saving your plugin list. After attending WordCamp Europe, the folks at <a href=\"http://raison.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Raison</a>, a WordPress development agency, decided to open source the plugin as part of their contribution towards the <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/\" target=\"_blank\">Five for the Future</a> initiative.</p>\n<p>Bulk Deactivate sets up shop under the Plugins menu in the admin and allows for tailoring exceptions via a dropdown select list of your active plugins.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bulk-deactivate.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33025]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33033\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bulk-deactivate.jpg?resize=925%2C586\" alt=\"bulk-deactivate\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ordinarily, after doing a bulk plugin deactivation, all your inactive plugins are lumped together. When using the Bulk Deactivate plugin as an alternative, you&#8217;ll get a saved list of the plugins that you just deactivated so you can easily re-activate them all again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/activate-saved-plugins.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33025]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33042\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/activate-saved-plugins.jpg?resize=828%2C408\" alt=\"activate-saved-plugins\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bulk Deactivate is not an all-or-nothing plugin. It can be configured a number of different ways to suit your particular debugging requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add exceptions, so essential plugins will not be deactivated</li>\n<li>Save a list of the plugins deactivated</li>\n<li>Activate the plugins you just deactivated</li>\n<li>Activate only a selection of the plugins just deactivated</li>\n<li>Advanced options for how the plugin save list is handled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next time you have to take up the task of isolating a plugin conflict, you might want to employ the help of the Bulk Deactivate plugin.

One reliable source of information is the <a title=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2014-results/\" href=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2014-results/\">WPShout webhosting survey</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite a goal of 500, only 159 people responded to the survey. Although it&#8217;s not a large data set, it provides enough information to get a feel for the webhosting scene in the WordPress ecosystem. The survey collected data in seven areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Average satisfaction</li>\n<li>Value</li>\n<li>Reliability</li>\n<li>Speed</li>\n<li>Support</li>\n<li>Median site count</li>\n<li>Usability</li>\n<li>WordPress compatibility</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each respondent was asked to provide an overall impression between 1-10 to each area with an option to provide a text comment. Monthly cost of a plan, number of sites hosted on the plan, and monthly traffic to hosted sites was also collected.</p>\n<h2>The Pricing Valley</h2>\n<p>One of the data points I find interesting is the graph showing customer experience by monthly cost. Those who use the cheapest hosting plans $0-$5 have the worst experience overall. Those who use plans in the $6-$15 range show a significantly higher satisfaction rate across the board. The customer experience level drops off with plans in the $16-$49 range.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CustomerSatisfactionLevels.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33003]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33004\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CustomerSatisfactionLevels.png?resize=866%2C580\" alt=\"Customer Satisfaction Levels\" /></a>Overall Satisfaction Levels Based on Monthly Cost\n<p>I&#8217;m surprised by this statistic since several of the managed WordPress hosting plans are in this price range. I expect customers to be the most satisfied with these plans since the service is catered to hosting WordPress sites. The results prove this isn&#8217;t the case and managed WordPress hosting providers have room for improvement. Customer satisfaction gradually rises with those who use plans that are $50 or more. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any surprise that the saying &#8220;you get what you pay for&#8221; applies to the webhosting industry.</p>\n<h2>Small or Specialty Webhosts Ranked Well</h2>\n<p>The results indicate smaller webhosting companies are not only agile in serving customer needs, they&#8217;re likely to provide an exceptional level of support. These types of companies fit into a mid-level tier of cost and popularity. Examples include <a title=\"https://getflywheel.com/\" href=\"https://getflywheel.com/\">Flywheel</a> and <a title=\"http://asmallorange.com/\" href=\"http://asmallorange.com/\">A Small Orange</a>. <a title=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\">Digital Ocean</a> also has a good showing with high rankings across the board.</p>\n<p>Established, large hosting companies such as <a title=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/\" href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/\">Dreamhost</a> and <a title=\"http://mediatemple.net/\" href=\"http://mediatemple.net/\">Media Temple</a>, have less than stellar ratings. Comment feedback indicates Dreamhost needs to improve not only its tech support, but reliability across the board. &#8220;I’ve liked Dreamhost in the past, but it seems the speed becomes slower each year, the servers become less reliable, and the support less helpful.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Things to Keep in Mind</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that ratings and averages for some webhosting companies in the survey are based on 2-5 responses. The data should not be used by itself to make decisions on which company to host a site with. Instead, use the data in combination with several other sources of information such as recommendations, personal research, and non-affiliated reviews.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to <a title=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2014-results/\" href=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2014-results/\">review the results</a> and if you want access to the raw survey data, <a title=\"contact@wpshout.com\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/contact@wpshout.com\">send a request</a> to WPShout.

Joost de Valk opened a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18548\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> three years ago, requesting a better option for controlling the output of title tags. He proposed a patch that would output the title tag during the run of wp_head, based on whether the current theme has added theme_support. This implementation is finally gaining traction, after a great deal of discussion among WordPress contributors.</p>\n<p>This week <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead\" target=\"_blank\">John Blackbourn</a>, the lead for WordPress 4.1, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/30074\" target=\"_blank\">committed</a> a forward-compatible way for allowing plugin and theme authors to better customize the output of document titles.  The upcoming release will introduce theme support for the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Title_Tag\" target=\"_blank\">title tag</a>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">add_theme_support( \'title-tag\' );</pre>\n<p><strong>&#8220;By declaring support like this, themes acknowledge that they are not defining titles on their own and WordPress can add it safely without duplication,&#8221;</strong> core contributor Konstantin Obenland explained when outlining title tag support in his most recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/29/title-tags-in-4-1/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> to the make/core blog.</p>\n<p>He elaborated further on the three year long effort, saying that it also served to correct an ancient practice of Kubrick, which appended the the blog name to <code>wp_title()</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php wp_title(\'&amp;laquo;\', true, \'right\'); ?&gt; &lt;?php bloginfo(\'name\'); ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</pre>\n<p>That practice became fairly standard in WordPress themes. The new theme support for the title tag will make it easier for plugins and themes to manage the document title.</p>\n<h3>New Template Functions for Archive Title and Descriptions</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.1 also introduces a couple of <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/30223\" target=\"_blank\">new template functions</a> for archive titles and descriptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>get_the_archive_title()</code> and <code>the_archive_title()</code> for returning/displaying the title of the current term, date, post type, post format, or author archive.</li>\n<li><code>get_the_archive_description()</code> and <code>the_archive_description()</code> for returning/displaying the description associated with the current term archive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developers will have these new functions at their disposal, thanks to efforts from Konstantin Obenland and Drew Jaynes.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in the business building WordPress themes, you will want to take note of how to use the new title tag with backwards compatibility, as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/29/title-tags-in-4-1/\" target=\"_blank\">outlined</a> by Obenland.</p>\n<p>At this time, plugin developers are discouraged from building functionality around theme support for title tags. <strong>&#8220;The long term plan is to enable users to manage document titles from their admin, independent of which theme they’re using,&#8221;</strong> Obenland explained. Changes in WordPress 4.1 are the first step towards making title tags more plugin friendly.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Nov 2014 21:36:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: WordSesh 3 is Set for December 20th, 2014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=32916\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://wptavern.com/wordsesh-3-is-set-for-december-20th-2014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3409:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WordSesh3FeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[32916]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32961\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WordSesh3FeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C266\" alt=\"WordSesh 3 Featured Image\" /></a></p>\n<p>The third annual <a title=\"http://wordsesh.org/\" href=\"http://wordsesh.org/\">WordSesh</a> will take place on December 20th, 2014 at UTC+0. Organized by <a title=\"http://scottbasgaard.com/\" href=\"http://scottbasgaard.com/\">Scott Basgaard</a>, WordSesh is like a virtual WordCamp except there is one session per hour for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Unlike <a title=\"http://second.wordsesh.org/\" href=\"http://second.wordsesh.org/\">WordSesh 2</a>, this year&#8217;s event will have one track instead of two. As in previous years, it will be free to attend. The decision to only have one track is based on feedback from WordSesh 2 attendees. &#8220;While WS2 was “bigger and better” it felt a bit unorganized and I’d like to capture having everyone in one place again,&#8221; Basgaard told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Basgaard is inviting specific individuals to speak at the event. The remaining slots will open to the public where speakers will be hand-picked. Sessions will be split into five categories with 3-4 sessions per category followed by a round table discussion. <a title=\"http://dradcast.com/\" href=\"http://dradcast.com/\">DradCast</a> will once again kick off the event in what has become part of the tradition. Basgaard sent the Tavern a tentative look at the schedule that includes the following categories: Business, Users, Themes, Plugins, and Community.</p>\n<h2>WordSesh is a Popular Event</h2>\n<p>Over 3,000 unique viewers from 85 different countries <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordsesh-recap-global-wordpress-event-pulls-3000-unique-viewers-from-85-countries\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordsesh-recap-global-wordpress-event-pulls-3000-unique-viewers-from-85-countries\">watched WordSesh 2</a>. Attendance for the event far exceeded that of most WordCamps. WordSesh 2 organizers shared some of their viewership stats on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordsesh\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and the results demonstrate that the event was a hit all over the world:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The city of Sofia, Bulgaria, had the most viewers of any city in the world, followed by London and New york.</li>\n<li>36 unique viewers from Africa</li>\n<li>98 unique viewers from Oceania</li>\n<li>120 unique viewers from Asia</li>\n<li>843 unique viewers from Europe</li>\n<li>1,404 unique viewers from North / South America</li>\n<li>3,000 unique viewers over 85 countries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordSesh 2 experienced a few technical issues last year, but simplifying the event should help it run more smoothly.

This means that your page load won&#8217;t be slowed down by requests for the plugin data.</p>\n<p>The plugin also includes a dashboard widget that can be set up by adding plugin slugs for the extensions you want to include. It&#8217;s easy to reorder via drag-and-drop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dashboard-widget-plugin-info.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[32894]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dashboard-widget-plugin-info.jpg?resize=699%2C552\" alt=\"dashboard-widget-plugin-info\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32946\" /></a></p>\n<p>The dashboard widget feature seems less useful than the shortcode, unless you are intent on monitoring specific plugin stats in a list. The shortcode, however, has a whole host of parameters for customizing the frontend display:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>slug:</strong> plugin slug name</li>\n<li><strong>image:</strong> image url to replace WP logo (default: empty)</li>\n<li><strong>logo:</strong> 128&#215;128.jpg, 256&#215;256.jpg, 128&#215;128.png, 256&#215;256.png, svg, no (default: svg)</li>\n<li><strong>banner:</strong> jpg, png, no (default:empty)</li>\n<li><strong>align:</strong> center, left, right (default: empty)</li>\n<li><strong>containerid:</strong> custom div id, may be used for anchor (default: wp-pic-PLUGIN-NAME)</li>\n<li><strong>margin:</strong> custom container margin &#8211; eg: &#8220;15px 0&#8243; (default: empty)</li>\n<li><strong>clear:</strong> clear float before or after the card: before, after (default: empty)</li>\n<li><strong>custom:</strong> value to output : url, name, version, author, requires, rating, num_ratings, downloaded, last_updated, download_link (default: empty)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that Capobianco put quite a bit of effort into the plugin to ensure that its users could customize it for their own unique uses. The examples shown above were created using just the basic shortcode for each plugin:</p>\n<p><code>[wp-pic slug=\"buddypress\"]</code></p>\n<p>WP Plugin Info Cards makes it easy to quickly create a list of your favorite plugins. You could also use it to showcase your own plugins or to create a list of plugins that you personally endorse. If you&#8217;re writing a guide or tutorial that requires the use of a collection of plugins, you could use WP Plugin Info Cards to easily build that list with download links for each.

Focus enhances the Distraction Free Writing mode in WordPress. Janneke Van Dorpe is the lead developer for the project with Mark Jaquith and Andrew Ozz contributing as well. Unlike DFW mode in WordPress 4.0, Focus keeps the meta boxes, admin bar, and left hand menu just a mouse swipe away from view.</p>\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-the-focus-project-plans-to-enhance-distraction-free-writing-in-wordpress#gallery-32888-1-slideshow\">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<p>Although the interface surrounding the editor disappears, users can access the admin bar without the surrounding interface showing up. The admin bar and meta boxes below and to the right of the post editor fade away while the menu on the left moves out of view. I don&#8217;t find the animation to be distracting and the menus come back into view quickly.</p>\n<p>According to Jaquith, Distraction Free Writing in WordPress has a few issues. He outlines three primary reasons for the changes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The transition to and from it is distracting. It&#8217;s a separate editor and it makes you lose your place.</li>\n<li>You don&#8217;t have access to the same editing tools, so you would feel like you had to keep switching back and forth.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s not very discoverable in the first place.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"message_content\">&#8220;Combine those things, and it just wasn&#8217;t compelling. Now, it engages when you type (fixing discoverability), its transition is seamless, but you still have instant access to all the same editing tools and all your regular meta boxes. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds,&#8221; Jaquith told the Tavern. </span></p>\n<p>I rarely use DFW mode in WordPress but after using the Focus plugin, I&#8217;m willing to give it a try. I like the fact that meta boxes and the menu are quickly accessible despite being hidden.</p>\n<h2>Needs Approval</h2>\n<p>John Blackbourn, who is <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead\">leading the release</a> of WordPress 4.1, has to determine whether the project is at a point where it can be merged into core. If it&#8217;s approved, those who update to WordPress 4.1 will see the enhancements currently in the Focus plugin. Once it&#8217;s merged into core, the plan is to use a <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/create-your-own-custom-pointers-in-the-wordpress-admin\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/create-your-own-custom-pointers-in-the-wordpress-admin\">feature pointer</a> to let users know of its existence.</p>\n<p>Since disabling DFW mode is as easy as pressing a button in the editor, this is a calculated risk. People who see the editor for the first time might make it their primary means of writing content. This in turn would lead to more users and possible improvements down the road. Even with using a feature pointer, I&#8217;m curious to see how users react to it being enabled after updating to WordPress 4.1.</p>\n<h2>How to Contribute to Focus</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to test drive the new DFW mode for WordPress, you can download it from the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/focus/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/focus/\">plugin directory</a>.

Today the Jetpack team officially <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/2014/11/03/jetpack-3-2/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the release, along with a new feature that wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the changelog.</p>\n<h2>Centralized Posting from WordPress.com</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/centralized-posting.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[32841]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32854\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/centralized-posting.png?resize=700%2C316\" alt=\"centralized-posting\" /></a></p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress sites connected via Jetpack can now publish posts using the WordPress.com post editor. When you visit <a title=\"WordPress.com Post Editor\" href=\"http://wordpress.com/post/\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.com/post/</a> you&#8217;ll find a dropdown of your sites above the title field. Here you can select a Jetpack-connected site. Once you either save or publish a post, a progress bar crawls across the screen as WordPress.com communicates to your site.</p>\n<p>On first look, it seems that WordPress.com is aiming to become a centralized place for publishing WordPress content, regardless of where the site is hosted.</p>\n<p>But this begs the question: <strong>Why would I want to post to my self-hosted site from WordPress.com?</strong> Many themes now incorporate customized editor styles to help match the preview to the frontend a little better. The self-hosted post editor also includes better access to the rest of your content and integration with plugins you&#8217;ve added to customize that experience.</p>\n<h3>The Idea Behind Centralizing Posting from WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>I spoke with Jetpack team member <a href=\"http://stephanis.info/\" target=\"_blank\">George Stephanis</a> regarding the idea and direction behind the new centralized publishing option. He identified a number of complementary purposes for the new feature. &#8220;One is to dogfood the <a title=\"WordPress.com REST API\" href=\"http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com REST API</a>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By using the REST API instead of the traditional wp-admin means, we can ensure we&#8217;ve covered edge cases in usage and that it&#8217;s appropriate for production usage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also sees the new posting option as a convenient way to get quick access to any of your sites. &#8220;Another purpose is for users that have fifty sites, and just want to throw quick thoughts up,&#8221; Stephanis said. When you have that many sites, accessing one through WordPress.com can be easier than going to the self-hosted admin and authenticating.</p>\n<p>However, he recognizes that centralized publishing is not necessarily beneficial for every site. &#8220;In-depth posts to customized installs will naturally have a better experience going right to their customized wp-admin editor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After testing, I can confirm that it is fully functional for remote publishing, although it leaves somewhat of a disconnect between writing and seeing the live content. If you publish content, chances are that you want to visit your site anyway to see it live. Unless you&#8217;re simply saving a quick draft to your site, remote publishing doesn&#8217;t yet appear to have many advantages apart from convenience.</p>\n<h3>Experimenting with the WordPress Admin</h3>\n<p>The centralized publishing experience is just a first step, Stephanis said. The Jetpack team has more planned. &#8220;There&#8217;s more iterations and ways of managing and writing content that we can slip in more comfortably to the new WordPress.com editor, specifically as it doesn&#8217;t have to support a lot of the old metaboxes and custom stuff that wp-admin has,&#8221; he explained. <strong>&#8220;So it&#8217;s a way to safely iterate, while still maintaining the old wp-admin side.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>The upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-api\" target=\"_blank\">WP REST API</a> for WordPress core, along with ongoing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this/\" target=\"_blank\">experiments with the Press This feature</a>, will open up many more opportunities for developers to publish to WordPress without using the traditional admin at all. The folks at WordPress.com are experimenting with their own REST API and Stephanis said he is &#8220;eager to see the external APIs converge, as there’s a lot that both current implementations can gain from the other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Centralized publishing isn&#8217;t the first WordPress.com REST API experiment. The <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-introduces-postbot-app-for-scheduling-photo-posts\" target=\"_blank\">Postbot app</a> introduced users to the possibility of publishing images without the admin.

Your own blog&#8217;s spam comments may have followed similar rises and falls, and seen some missed spam comments. Please mark those missed comments as spam so that Akismet can learn from your feedback.

Playing together like this is something we do regularly, but I hope that everyone enjoys sharing what we do with the world, and doing it for a good cause.\r\nHow many people from your group are you hoping will take part?\r\n\r\nWe\'ll have three people trying to do the full 24 hours, and around 20 part-timers at various times throughout the day. There will be quite a cast of characters on our stream throughout the day.\r\nWhat is going to make your group different?\r\n\r\nWe\'re going to be doing a little bit of everything! PvP, PvE, Sandbox games, and MMO\'s. We\'ve got a wide range of skills levels, experiences, and playstyles in Relics of Orr and we\'ll do our best to showcase all of them.\r\nWhat in jokes does your guild have?\r\n\r\nThere are far too many in jokes to detail here, but I\'d have to say my favorites are the abundance of non sequiturs. It\'s a regular occurrence to reply to nonsense with nonsense of your own until there\'s an almost logical flow to it. Also tacos.\r\nHow frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?\r\n\r\nWe\'ve often been supportive of community and charitable events in the past. One of our favorites is Pink Day in LA, and we\'ve been in attendance every year since 2009. Healing Over Time will be our biggest involvement in a charity event to date.\r\nWhat games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?\r\n\r\nWe\'re especially excited about getting back to our roots in Guild Wars. We\'re planning on playing Alliance Battles, one of our favorite game-modes of all time. We\'ll be the ones running around shouting \"HAMSTORM!!!\" like fools in all chat. There are kids in candy stores less excited than we are to be Hamstorming again.\r\nWhat plans have you got for keeping everyone motivated for the full 24 hours?\r\n\r\nWe\'ll be changing up what we\'re doing and who we\'re playing with often, so I\'m hoping that will keep us on our toes. Also energy drinks. And maybe showers.

Many of us will have fond memories of playing with or against our siblings, parents and friends. For some, gaming will have helped us through a tough time in our lives. Unfortunately this isn\'t an experience that can be shared with everyone, due to illness, poverty and war.\r\n\r\nHealing Over Time brings gamers from all walks of life and locations around the world to reach out to those who need a helping hand. Organisations of gamers play the games they love, have bonded over, and are excited about for 24 hours, hoping that their fun and community spirit will reach out to those who need it most.\r\n\r\nOf course, one of the best ways of doing this is by raising money for charities with connections to those in need. Every charity we raise money for works internationally and aims to improve the health and life of others. This time around we\'ll be raising money for Child\'s Play.\r\n\r\nHealing Over Time started life in December 2012 as MYSTathon. 8 members of the guild Mystic Spiral [MYST] played DOTA2 and Guild Wars 2 for 24 hours, supported by more than 10 other members. The event raised over $525 for Child\'s Play. It was so much fun they decided to do it again and get other guilds involved, leading to the creation of Healing Over Time.\r\n\r\nThis March, our staff will be joined by Mystic Spiral, Enigma, Relics of Orr, Afterlife, Dragon Season, Subterfuge Gaming, BOON Control, and Viking Nation during Healing Over Time. With prizes and good times ahead we hope you\'ll help us smash our target of $5000.\r\n\r\nTogether, we\'ll show the world the benefits of gaming, one hour at a time.','About','','inherit','open','open','','23-revision-v1','','','2014-08-16 02:51:01','2014-08-16 02:51:01','',23,'http://localhost/2014/08/23-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(25,1,'2014-08-16 02:51:34','2014-08-16 02:51:34','','About','','publish','open','open','','25','','','2014-08-26 18:41:20','2014-08-26 18:41:20','',0,'http://localhost/?p=25',6,'nav_menu_item','',0),(26,1,'2014-11-11 18:39:29','2014-11-11 18:39:29','Here at Healing Over Time, we think online communities are great.

Across Europe, 25% of all people play games at least once a week <a title=\"ISFE\" href=\"http://www.isfe.eu/industry-facts\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>. Despite this, gamers are frequently misrepresented. Whilst recent research shows a 48% of gamers are female, and 49% are over the age of 35 <a title=\"ESA 2014\" href=\"http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/esa_ef_2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a>, gamers are frequently considered to be predominately young males.\r\n\r\nIt\'s not just the outside world that has it wrong. Within the industry and the gaming community there are frequent frustrations about issues such as accessibility, anti-social behaviour and representation.\r\n\r\nDespite this, there is a lot of good going on in gaming. There\'s growing scientific evidence that playing games improves learning and raises self-esteem. There\'s plenty of anecdotal evidence that games can help families and friends stay in touch, as well as enabling people to cope with difficult times in their lives.\r\n\r\nThe benefits aren\'t just personal. In 2013, gamers raised over $11 million for Extra Life and Child\'s Play, with plenty of other fundraising campaigns for other charities. <strong>Gaming organisations such as guilds are often a first step t</strong>\r\n\r\nHealing Over Time is run by and for those who enjoy playing video games, regardless of their experience level or physical location. <strong>We want to help gamers and gaming be the best it can be.</strong>\r\n\r\nWe do this by helping gamer communities to grow and aim high, enabling people to find the information they\'re seeking, tackling the hard topics and changing misconceptions about those who enjoy gaming.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"What we do\" href=\"http://localhost/what-we-do/\">Find out more.</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Our Organisation</h2>\r\nHealing Over Time is applying to become a non-profit organisation within the United Kingdom. This allows us to minimise our expenditure whilst still being as productive as we possibly can be.\r\n\r\nEveryone running and aiding the organisation is a volunteer. All staff members are passionate gamers.\r\n\r\nWe fundraise to continue and expand our work, and to support other non-profit organisations and charities. Who we support changes over time and we will always be transparent about where your money goes.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Our History</h2>\r\nThe organisation has been borne from a number of gaming communities coming together with similar interests. In December 2012, the guild Mystic Spiral ran a 24 hour gaming marathon which raised $525 for Child\'s Play. In March 2014 the first Healing Over Time event took place, with 7 guilds coming together for a joint marathon which raised $6,456 for Child\'s Play, supported by <a title=\"Supporters\" href=\"http://localhost/supporters/\">industry partners including Green Man Gaming</a>.\r\n\r\nFrom there we\'ve aimed higher and wider.

Their goal was to spend 24 hours playing Guild Wars 2 and Dota 2 together as a community in order to raise money for charity and streaming all the fun and hilarity that went along with such an event. In total, 11 members took part, 8 for the full 24 hours and they managed to raise over $500. Realising what a brilliant experience this could be, it seemed to make sense to try and make this bigger and better - and thus Healing Over Time was born.\r\n\r\nWe talked to two of the current members of Mystic Spiral who were involved in the event about what it was like to take part, what their best and worst memories were and what they were hoping to see from this years event. Lyuna and Nemo have both been members of the guild since 2009 and were involved for the full 24 hours.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What made you volunteer to take part in MYSTathon at the time?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>Nemo:</strong> Mainly the fun of it all, it\'s pretty great to do what you like to do for 24 hours straight. And totally doesn\'t begin hurting at all. I also think Child\'s Play does amazing things. I can\'t imagine anything I would want to do more than playing video games while i\'m at hospital.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lyuna:</strong> At the time I already knew that big names like, for example, the Yogscast did livestreams for charity. So when the idea for one of our own came up I was already loving the idea. After all, what would be more awesome than being able to do charity work together with friends, doing something we all love? It really wasn\'t that hard a decision to make in the end, it just came up and I wanted to help.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What did you get up to during the event?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>N:</strong> Mainly DotA 2 and GW2, I recall it getting to about 5am (19 hours into the marathon) and I just conceded to my tiredness and began torching everything with my engi\'s flamethrower. Things got better from then. I didn\'t stream last time, but that might change this time around; be ready for top10 MLG #pureskill plays.\r\n\r\n<strong>L:</strong> I wasn\'t a streamer back then, I just played. And played. And played some more. The only games we did back then were Guild Wars 2 and DOTA2 and since I don\'t have the latter I spent all of my 24 hours on Guild Wars 2, doing a wide variety of content. I did do some content writing for our website beforehand, but that really didn\'t amount to much.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What are some of your best memories of the experience?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>N:</strong> I recall racing Andy (our lead streamer) in a jumping puzzle. I don\'t think it went well for me...Or him for that matter. As well as some of the Divine Courage DotA hero builds I had to deal with. (Manta first warlock is pretty good I hear..)\r\n\r\n<strong>L:</strong> Among things, perhaps that point where we were all so tired that the most random of conversations came up. Maybe it wasn\'t as funny to watch than to take part, but attempting to do Arah explorable at about 4 in the morning was about as hilarious as it was frustrating.\r\n\r\nThere was also seeing that people were actually watching us and donating. We didn\'t reach our intended goal of donations, but I still found it heartwarming that people appreciated what we were doing, and were supporting our cause. I went in mostly without expectations, so the outcome was really amazing to me.\r\n\r\nActually there are a lot of really good and fun memories (being trolled by a guildmate during jumping puzzles, though I still pretend to be angry at that, or finally beating Crucible of Eternity and beating the second group to it...) so I\'m very sure it\'ll be as much fun this time around.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5> <strong>Were there any points that made you wonder why you were doing this?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>N:</strong> After falling off a jumping puzzle I\'d cleared 5 times before without failing, about 20 times I began to know what real anger felt like, but I managed to control myself, and do what any hardworking individual would do... And give up.\r\n\r\n<strong>L:</strong> Actually I don\'t think there were. Of course there was the occasional \"I want to sleeeeeep\", but nothing that made me actually question the whole event.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What were some of your worst memories of the experience?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>N:</strong> Simply CoE. There aren\'t words to describe the pain that dungeon put us all through. Never again... Never.\r\n\r\n<strong>L:</strong> And again I have to say trying Arah explorable. I don\'t even know how many hours we were in there, and in the end we never even made it past Lupicus before we gave up. I\'m pretty sure most of us ended up completely naked for that run too, since we ran out of money to repair. Or at least I did. Utterly infuriating and frustrating, though funny looking back at it – and realizing that now we\'re actually able to do the dungeon mostly without issues.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Did you do anything special to prepare before you started?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>N:</strong> Bought 2 litres of energy drinks and decided going to bed at 3am the night before was intelligent.\r\n\r\n<strong>L:</strong> Sleep a lot? Buy a ton of energy drinks? (Not recommended, I actually got very very twitchy towards the end of the 24 hours. Don\'t overdose on energy drinks, kiddos!) I also stocked up on a lot of snacks, but I\'m not sure that actually counts as preparation XD\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5> <strong>Have you got any advice for this years participants?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>N:</strong> I want them to suffer like we did, so no.\r\n\r\n<strong>L:</strong> See the above, don\'t be like me and overdose on energy drinks. &gt;_&gt; Other than that, don\'t take yourself too seriously and play to have fun.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>Will we be seeing you again this year?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>N:</strong> Yep! I\'ll be playing the FPS\'s mainly. No GW2 for me this year!\r\n\r\n<strong>L:</strong> Decidedly yes. Actually I\'m one of MYST\'s streamers this year, at <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/lyunatic\" target=\"_blank\">twitch.tv/lyunatic</a> :3\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>So what are you looking forward to the most about this years event?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>N:</strong> Mainly Payday 2 and L4D. Also any other games we can pickup! Hopefully we can get some pretty cool stuff to try out as well <strong>*hinthint*</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>L:</strong> Last year I played Guild Wars 2 exclusively (no DOTA2 for me), but this year we have a much wider variety of games we\'ll be playing. I\'m excited to see how that will go down (and looking forward to kicking people\'s butts during pvp-type activities, bwahahaha). I think across all our streams we\'ve got a healthy mix of all types of games, so anyone can find something fun to watch at any time :D\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5> <strong>Anything further you\'d like to add?</strong></h5>\r\n<strong>N:</strong> Things are bound to go wrong on the day, don\'t hesitate to contact us if there are problems! (especially with vent volumes etc)\r\n\r\n<strong>L:</strong> Nothing that I can think of, so I think that\'s a no?','The Origins of Healing Over Time','','publish','closed','closed','','the-origins-of-healing-over-time','','','2014-11-03 19:21:48','2014-11-03 19:21:48','',0,'http://localhost/?p=90',0,'post','',0),(91,1,'2014-11-03 19:18:36','2014-11-03 19:18:36','As preparations are now fully underway for our first event as Healing Over Time on the 29th March, it seemed like a good time to look back and discuss how we got started and talk to a few of the people involved about what they got up to.\r\n\r\nHealing Over Time initially started out as the event <a href=\"http://www.mysticspiral.co.uk/charity/\" target=\"_blank\">MYSTathon</a>, a 24-hour gaming marathon that took place on December 22nd 2012, organised by the guild Mystic Spiral.

Over the years they have received many positive stories about how having a game or a toy can help make a stay in hospital more enjoyable and less stressful helping to distract from pain or discomfort whilst providing a sense of normalcy allowing play with family and friends. In addition, items like the Kinect or the Wii Balance board can help during physical therapy sessions to engage children in a fun and approachable way.\r\n\r\nWe also understand the positive impact can gaming can have on lives around the world. All of the groups involved with the Healing Over Time event are social organisations that emphasise the idea that playing together with friends and sharing experiences can help improve and enrich our lives.

Over the years they have received many positive stories about how having a game or a toy can help make a stay in hospital more enjoyable and less stressful helping to distract from pain or discomfort whilst providing a sense of normalcy allowing play with family and friends. In addition, items like the Kinect or the Wii Balance board can help during physical therapy sessions to engage children in a fun and approachable way.\r\n\r\nWe also understand the positive impact can gaming can have on lives around the world. All of the groups involved with the Healing Over Time event are social organisations that emphasise the idea that playing together with friends and sharing experiences can help improve and enrich our lives.

Starting small, we have evolved from a small guild into a community of friends who sometimes happen to play the same games together. With members from Asia, Australia, America and primarily Europe and a relaxed attitude, we strive to create a great gaming experience for everyone. We follow the principle that just because you play for fun doesn\'t mean you can\'t be good at it or succeed at the hardest content. Right now we\'re enjoying playing games like Guild Wars 2 and DOTA2, and we\'re looking forward to sharing our excitement for these games with you during the event.\"</em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How were you introduced to Healing Over Time?</strong></h5>\r\nHealing Over Time grew out of an event that MYST did a couple of years ago. MYST is primarily about friendship and having fun, and after a few conversations it seemed like opening the doors to other guilds and organisations was a good way of multiplying the benefits for everyone; the participants, viewers and Child\'s Play.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What do you hope your group will get out of participating in the event?</strong></h5>\r\nMostly I hope they\'ll have a great time and we\'ll be able to share that with everyone who watches. As Nemo and Lyuna\'s interview can attest, we have some good memories of the last time, which is why we\'re so eager to do it again. Events like these are great for bringing communities together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How many people from your group are you hoping will take part?</strong></h5>\r\nWe\'re going to have approximately 15 people playing for 24 hours and an estimated 10 more who join us for part of that time. We\'ll be highlighting three of the streams from the Healing Over Time website, but there\'ll be other streams available if you want a different perspective. Whichever stream you join, you\'ll have ears in on our voice server. We\'re looking at playing a wide variety of games throughout the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What is going to make your group different?</strong></h5>\r\nMYST is approaching its 8th birthday and a good number of our members have been with us since before 2008. This means we know each other well and have a lot of history, but we\'re open to newcomers as well. We\'re going to be aiming to treat the viewers as a new member of the guild and have them join in with the fun.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What in-jokes does your guild have?</strong></h5>\r\nThere\'s quite a few, here\'s some of them:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>\"MYST noob guild\"</strong> – Early in GW2, we had a PUG call us a \"noob guild\" because something didn\'t go perfectly first time in a dungeon. This was their idea of encouragement! We wear it like a badge of honour.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Andy can\'t be trusted</strong> – Guild Leader Andy has a habit of leaving people to die in shooters like Left 4 Dead 2. If he\'s on your team, don\'t expect him to come back for you.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>If anything goes wrong, it\'s Aaron\'s fault</strong> – early in his days in the guild, he volunteered as the scapegoat. He\'s been (jokingly) blamed for everything from game crashing bugs and delays in release to people being late for events.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?</strong></h5>\r\nWe get involved with them every few months – they\'re really good fun. We helped out with <a href=\"http://pinkday.gamergivingback.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pink Day in LA</a> for the last 2 years in addition to MYSTathon in 2012.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?</strong></h5>\r\nPersonally I\'m looking forward to some of the Minecraft maps we\'re looking at playing, and playing some Guild Wars 2. The Minecraft maps look like they\'ll make some great friendly competition (we\'re looking at playing Hunt for the Wool and Hunger Games amongst others).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What plans have you got for keeping everyone motivated for the full 24 hours?</strong></h5>\r\nI\'m hoping that the viewers can get involved and set us a target that we\'ve got to try to hit. Hopefully focussing on a competition will help people get past their barriers. Alternatively getting us to do silly things like sing for your money will keep people perked up.\r\n\r\nAlso showers. I can\'t tell you how blissful and reinvigorating a shower is at the 20 hour mark.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing how Mystic Spiral will get on during the marathon and if you\'d like to know more about the guild itself you can visit <a href=\"http://www.mysticspiral.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">their website</a> or contact them through twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_MysticSpiral\" target=\"_blank\">@_MysticSpiral</a>.','Meet Our Healers: Mystic Spiral','','publish','closed','closed','','meet-our-healers-mystic-spiral','','','2014-11-17 23:57:27','2014-11-17 23:57:27','',0,'http://localhost/?p=101',0,'post','',0),(102,1,'2014-11-03 19:27:01','2014-11-03 19:27:01','','Meet Our Healers: Mystic Spiral','','inherit','open','open','','101-revision-v1','','','2014-11-03 19:27:01','2014-11-03 19:27:01','',101,'http://localhost/2014/11/101-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(103,1,'2014-11-03 19:27:23','2014-11-03 19:27:23','Today we start with the first of many pieces where we talk to our participating guilds about what made them what to take part, what they hope to see and what you can expect to see from them during their time in the event.

What more could you ask from a charity event but good games, great people and lots of friends. Possibly lots of donations for the kids?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What do you hope your group will get out of participating in the event?</strong></h5>\r\nHonestly we hope that we get to have a great time and anything we make for charity is worth the effort. Every shiny denomination of your unit of currency counts. The donation widget cannot accept goats, chickens or skritt shiny!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How many people from your group are you hoping will take part?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are contributing two full time 24 hour streamers. We expect the guild to drop in and out throughout the day but we haven’t had any hard and fast additional streamers mostly due to technical reasons or shyness on camera. Still we will leave a swathe of death, destruction and empty coffee cups behind us!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What is going to make your group different?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are looking to be a gap bridge between a number of our other streamers. A number of the groups involved are heavily centred around Guild Wars 2 or Wildstar. We’ve got interest with guilds active across a number of games and we will be popping up across most of the games. Expect to see us dropping in on the other streamers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?</strong></h5>\r\nWe do try to run some sort of charitable event on an annual basis even if it is just to get rid of all the swag we build up. Last year we had one person stream for 24 hours and made a few hundred pounds for charity. If every streamer for HoT makes this we should smash the target for this years HoT!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?</strong></h5>\r\nI\'m just looking forward to having an excuse to go to WvW with my guild on stream. It\'s been far too long since we brought the stream out and got the wider community involved in the game. If chat is busy enough we might even let them drive!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What plans have you got for keeping everyone motivated for the full 24 hours?</strong></h5>\r\nI will be using excessive amounts of coffee! Also from my experience you need to play something that you really, really enjoy and isn’t too cerebral during hours 17-20ish - you don’t want to flake out on the audience.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfterlife can be reached through their <a href=\"http://www.afterlife-gaming.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> or <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/afterlifelegion\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> if you’d like to know more about the group and the many games they’re involved with.

Enigma is not only a guild, but also a vibrant community of gamers, with friendships that transcend the games we play. Taken as a whole we are from all walks of life and nationalities, we are tolerant and social, but we are also driven – to be the best that we can be at all times. Our guild credo is \'Pro Bonus Dolus, Pro Palmo Ego\' - which roughly translates as \'For the good of the guild, before the glory of self\'. We expect to genuinely see this attitude in the day to day choices our members make.\"</em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How were you introduced to Healing Over Time?</strong></h5>\r\nA number of people within the guild have been aware of HoT for some time! Its a great opportunity to help a worthwhile cause, by doing something we are passionate about - gaming. Not only do we get to play more games together, its another chance to share some goals and work together, as a guild we thrive on challenges and its great to be able to put our efforts to good use for the community.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How many people from your group are you hoping will take part?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are currently planning to have 5 Enigmates participated with 1 stream. 1 of our participants will be part time. Unfortunately the event collides with EGXRezzed, which has precluded a few people from doing the full 24 hours (I fall into this category!) However I am sure as group we will get the job done!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What is going to make your group different?</strong></h5>\r\nDoes doing things the enigma way count ? You will find a blend of humour, personalities, nationalities, and hairstyles in the guild. We don\'t tend to follow the script that often when it comes to gaming - we prefer to write our own. From the Comedic to the Analytical, there should be something for everyone amongst the guild streams.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What in jokes does your guild have?</strong></h5>\r\nThere is a lot of backstory and in jokes within a guild that has been together for nearly a decade! From a raid where monty python kills tanks (true story!), to flying kitchen sinks. From many real life meet-ups to a guild leader that gets lost (allegedly) there is always something happening in Enigma.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?</strong></h5>\r\nWe have often supported individuals within the guild for charitable events, but I think this may be the first time we have put the guild out there as a \'entity\' for a charitable event!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are looking to play a multitude of different genres from MMO\'s to Moba style gaming. We are also looking at arrange a guild-match-off against Myst in Dota 2\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What plans have you got for keeping everyone motivated for the full 24 hours?</strong></h5>\r\nBy taking this on as a team exercise for those in the guild.

A large part of the community is from Greece, so the content on the website is offered both in Greek and English. Similarly, the Dragon Season guild is international with members from many different countries. Our vision is to be a place where everybody feels welcome and a part of the Dragon Season family. We are mainly found in Guild Wars 2 (and 1!), but as is common for gamers, we play a variety of games and also have a tiny child guild in Rift.\"</em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How were you introduced to Healing Over Time?</strong></h5>\r\nSam, the lead organizer of Healing over Time has been a friend of mine for quite a while now. Dragon Season always had a close relationship with her guild \"Mystic Spiral\" and tried to assist them with their ongoing projects on way or another. I guess that\'s the reason we are part of this charity event. Our sole purpose is to help others and we are here to actively show our support.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What do you hope your group will get out of participating in the event?</strong></h5>\r\nWe don\'t hope to gain something personal out of our participation in Healing over Time. Our only hope would be for this event to be successful and help those in need.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How many people from your group are you hoping will take part?</strong></h5>\r\nAs much as we\'d like to stream for the event, it seems like our internet connections won\'t allow us to do so. The generous organizers of Healing over Time though have allowed us to contribute by taking on some other tasks like chat moderation, to ensure that everything will progress rather smoothly on that front, or by joining the streamers in game during the event.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What is going to make your group different?</strong></h5>\r\nWe like having fun. So, if we were to compete with the rest of the guilds, within the boundaries of good sportsmanship, that would be our motivation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What in-jokes does your guild have?</strong></h5>\r\nWe don\'t have injokes. But we have people that are fun to have around and there\'s often laughter involved when they\'re there.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?</strong></h5>\r\nQuite often I\'d say. We tend to get involved in <a href=\"http://pinkday.gamergivingback.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pink Day in LA</a> and the <a href=\"http://pinkday.gamergivingback.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MS Toga party</a> for multiple sclerosis each year, both organized by <a href=\"http://pinkday.gamergivingback.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gamer\'s Giving Back.</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?</strong></h5>\r\nYou\'ll find us in games like Guild Wars 2, Rift, Torchlight 2, Team Fortress 2 and League of Legends if everything goes according to plan.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What plans have you got for keeping everyone motivated for the full 24 hours?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are quite used to living life to the fullest, so I don\'t that think either fatigue or lack of motivation will be that much of a problem.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you\'d like to discover more about Dragon Season and what else they\'re getting up to send them a tweet <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/DragonSeasonCom\" target=\"_blank\">@DragonSeasonCom</a> or visit their<a href=\"http://www.dragonseason.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.','Meet Our Healers: Dragon Season','','inherit','closed','open','','109-revision-v1','','','2014-11-17 23:50:50','2014-11-17 23:50:50','',109,'http://www.healingovertime.org/2014/11/109-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(148,1,'2014-11-17 23:57:27','2014-11-17 23:57:27','Today we start with the first of many pieces where we talk to our participating guilds about what made them what to take part, what they hope to see and what you can expect to see from them during their time in the event.

Starting small, we have evolved from a small guild into a community of friends who sometimes happen to play the same games together. With members from Asia, Australia, America and primarily Europe and a relaxed attitude, we strive to create a great gaming experience for everyone. We follow the principle that just because you play for fun doesn\'t mean you can\'t be good at it or succeed at the hardest content. Right now we\'re enjoying playing games like Guild Wars 2 and DOTA2, and we\'re looking forward to sharing our excitement for these games with you during the event.\"</em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How were you introduced to Healing Over Time?</strong></h5>\r\nHealing Over Time grew out of an event that MYST did a couple of years ago. MYST is primarily about friendship and having fun, and after a few conversations it seemed like opening the doors to other guilds and organisations was a good way of multiplying the benefits for everyone; the participants, viewers and Child\'s Play.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What do you hope your group will get out of participating in the event?</strong></h5>\r\nMostly I hope they\'ll have a great time and we\'ll be able to share that with everyone who watches. As Nemo and Lyuna\'s interview can attest, we have some good memories of the last time, which is why we\'re so eager to do it again. Events like these are great for bringing communities together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How many people from your group are you hoping will take part?</strong></h5>\r\nWe\'re going to have approximately 15 people playing for 24 hours and an estimated 10 more who join us for part of that time. We\'ll be highlighting three of the streams from the Healing Over Time website, but there\'ll be other streams available if you want a different perspective. Whichever stream you join, you\'ll have ears in on our voice server. We\'re looking at playing a wide variety of games throughout the day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What is going to make your group different?</strong></h5>\r\nMYST is approaching its 8th birthday and a good number of our members have been with us since before 2008. This means we know each other well and have a lot of history, but we\'re open to newcomers as well. We\'re going to be aiming to treat the viewers as a new member of the guild and have them join in with the fun.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What in-jokes does your guild have?</strong></h5>\r\nThere\'s quite a few, here\'s some of them:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>\"MYST noob guild\"</strong> – Early in GW2, we had a PUG call us a \"noob guild\" because something didn\'t go perfectly first time in a dungeon. This was their idea of encouragement! We wear it like a badge of honour.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Andy can\'t be trusted</strong> – Guild Leader Andy has a habit of leaving people to die in shooters like Left 4 Dead 2. If he\'s on your team, don\'t expect him to come back for you.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>If anything goes wrong, it\'s Aaron\'s fault</strong> – early in his days in the guild, he volunteered as the scapegoat. He\'s been (jokingly) blamed for everything from game crashing bugs and delays in release to people being late for events.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?</strong></h5>\r\nWe get involved with them every few months – they\'re really good fun. We helped out with <a href=\"http://pinkday.gamergivingback.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pink Day in LA</a> for the last 2 years in addition to MYSTathon in 2012.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?</strong></h5>\r\nPersonally I\'m looking forward to some of the Minecraft maps we\'re looking at playing, and playing some Guild Wars 2. The Minecraft maps look like they\'ll make some great friendly competition (we\'re looking at playing Hunt for the Wool and Hunger Games amongst others).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What plans have you got for keeping everyone motivated for the full 24 hours?</strong></h5>\r\nI\'m hoping that the viewers can get involved and set us a target that we\'ve got to try to hit. Hopefully focussing on a competition will help people get past their barriers. Alternatively getting us to do silly things like sing for your money will keep people perked up.\r\n\r\nAlso showers. I can\'t tell you how blissful and reinvigorating a shower is at the 20 hour mark.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing how Mystic Spiral will get on during the marathon and if you\'d like to know more about the guild itself you can visit <a href=\"http://www.mysticspiral.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">their website</a> or contact them through twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_MysticSpiral\" target=\"_blank\">@_MysticSpiral</a>.','Meet Our Healers: Mystic Spiral','','inherit','closed','open','','101-revision-v1','','','2014-11-17 23:57:27','2014-11-17 23:57:27','',101,'http://www.healingovertime.org/2014/11/101-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(149,1,'2014-11-17 23:57:38','2014-11-17 23:57:38','Today we had the honor of chatting to <a href=\"http://booncontrol.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BOON Control</a> about the creation of Healing Over Time and what they were hoping to bring to the table for the event. Acina the GM of their World of Warcraft guild answered our questions:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.healingovertime.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/boon_control.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-143\" src=\"http://www.healingovertime.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/boon_control-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"boon_control\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<em>\"BOON Control is an EU gaming community that has evolved over the years from a PvP raid guild in 2005, to the multi-game focus it has today. Over the years we have made a name for ourselves in PvP/RvR based games, most notably in Aion where we were a driving force on our server, this grit and determination to be the best transferred to Guild Wars 2 where again we strived to be the best. In 2013 a small contingent returned to WoW, initially with no intent, but we\'re not able to do things by halves. Currently we are progressing through Heroic level content, with an eye on Mystic raiding and server firsts in Warlords of Dreanor. As well as WoW we have a guild ready for Elder Scrolls online, WildStar and members can be found in a plethora of other online games. Why not pop by and say hello, we don\'t bite!\"</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How were you introduced to Healing Over Time?</strong></h5>\r\nWe met up with Tasha and several other members of Mystic Spiral at gamescom 2013, one evening we talked about MYSTathon and how we could make it bigger. A few months later we had a fully fleshed out plan to have 6/7 guilds work together to raise money for Child\'s Play. Here we are today, ready and waiting!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What do you hope your group will get out of participating in the event?</strong></h5>\r\nWe as a group are looking to have fun for 24 hours, laugh at each other\'s early morning mistakes and raise a heap of money for Child\'s Play.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How many people from your group are you hoping will take part?</strong></h5>\r\nWe will have 12 people playing full-time for the 24 hours with a roughly the same again helping part-time. As with the other guilds, we are looking to highlight three streams on the Healing Over Time website. We plan to have a hardcore Diablo 3 faceoff between two of our streams as well as a variety of other games being played on the third.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What is going to make your group different?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are quite a reclusive guild; one of our main rules is that members are encouraged to avoid public forums etc, in part due to being a PvP guild and part of that community, how it tends to be rife with drama. I fully expect things to start off slow but as we get further in, people will get chattier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What in jokes does your guild have? Can you tell us the stories behind them?</strong></h5>\r\nHonestly most of them cannot be publicised, one thing you may notice is there will be much use of the word \"thingy\". The main source will be Tvar and oddly enough everyone will generally understand what it has been substituted for, even when there are thingies strung together to make a full sentence. Other than that, I fully expect the guild to be on their best behaviour!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?</strong></h5>\r\nIndividually we have been in many charity events over the years, members get involved as often as they can.

Over the years they have received many positive stories about how having a game or a toy can help make a stay in hospital more enjoyable and less stressful helping to distract from pain or discomfort whilst providing a sense of normalcy allowing play with family and friends. In addition, items like the Kinect or the Wii Balance board can help during physical therapy sessions to engage children in a fun and approachable way.\r\n\r\nWe also understand the positive impact can gaming can have on lives around the world. All of the groups involved with the Healing Over Time event are social organisations that emphasise the idea that playing together with friends and sharing experiences can help improve and enrich our lives. That\'s why all the games we\'ll be playing during our event will be multiplayer, and that\'s why we\'ll be streaming it all, so that you too can get involved. Many of us has witnessed the benefits of gaming first hand, from meeting new people who have grown to be very old friends, to offering support during difficult times in our life or simply being the stable to come home too at the end of a long day. Feel free to come and share your stories too on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HealingOverTime\" target=\"_blank\">facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/healingovertime\" target=\"_blank\">@healingovertime on twitter</a> where we discuss how gaming has helped us and share our experiences.\r\n\r\nChild\'s Play accomplishes their goal in two ways, helping hospitals set up wish lists of toys and video games that can then be used to send a specific gift to that location and by accepting cash donations which go towards purchasing consoles, peripherals and games that are then distributed to hospitals and therapy centres. This is where we (and hopefully you) come in. Our <a href=\"https://donate.childsplaycharity.org/969428f50ad95c0cbf0849511950bf51/\" target=\"_blank\">donation page</a> is already open for our March 29th 24 hour marathon and we\'re hoping you can help us smash our target of $5000 to show that gaming can really help and have a positive effect on the world around us.\r\n\r\nYou can see the effect of Child\'s Play in <a href=\"http://youtu.be/YbXhzN191ao?t=16s\" target=\"_blank\">this video made in 2009</a> featuring the children and staff of Randwick Children\'s Hospital in Australia and reading the <a href=\"http://www.childsplaycharity.org/testimonials\" target=\"_blank\">testimonials on their website.</a>','Who are we supporting this year?','','inherit','closed','open','','95-revision-v1','','','2014-11-17 23:58:11','2014-11-17 23:58:11','',95,'http://www.healingovertime.org/2014/11/95-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(151,1,'2014-11-17 23:59:19','2014-11-17 23:59:19','Today we had a chat to Kate (aka Spirit) one of the six guild leads of Relics of Orr about their reasons for participating in the event and their plans for making it through the whole twenty four hours.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.healingovertime.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/relics_of_orr.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-9\" src=\"http://www.healingovertime.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/relics_of_orr-1024x578.jpg\" alt=\"relics_of_orr\" width=\"720\" height=\"406\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>\"Relics of Orr is a North American based guild that originated in 2007 in Guild Wars.

While the majority of our players are from the United States and Canada, a number of us hail from all around the globe, from the UK to New Zealand. Our members tend to be largely PvE players, but the guild also encompasses and encourages a wide range of play-styles and interests.\"</em>\r\nHow were you introduced to Healing Over Time?\r\n\r\n[MYST] were our allies in the later years of Guild Wars, and we were excited to be invited to participate with them in Healing Over Time after seeing how much they enjoyed MYSTathon.\r\nWhat do you hope your group will get out of participating in the event?\r\n\r\nI hope everyone has a good time and makes some memories together. Playing together like this is something we do regularly, but I hope that everyone enjoys sharing what we do with the world, and doing it for a good cause.\r\nHow many people from your group are you hoping will take part?\r\n\r\nWe\'ll have three people trying to do the full 24 hours, and around 20 part-timers at various times throughout the day. There will be quite a cast of characters on our stream throughout the day.\r\nWhat is going to make your group different?\r\n\r\nWe\'re going to be doing a little bit of everything! PvP, PvE, Sandbox games, and MMO\'s. We\'ve got a wide range of skills levels, experiences, and playstyles in Relics of Orr and we\'ll do our best to showcase all of them.\r\nWhat in jokes does your guild have?\r\n\r\nThere are far too many in jokes to detail here, but I\'d have to say my favorites are the abundance of non sequiturs. It\'s a regular occurrence to reply to nonsense with nonsense of your own until there\'s an almost logical flow to it. Also tacos.\r\nHow frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?\r\n\r\nWe\'ve often been supportive of community and charitable events in the past. One of our favorites is Pink Day in LA, and we\'ve been in attendance every year since 2009. Healing Over Time will be our biggest involvement in a charity event to date.\r\nWhat games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?\r\n\r\nWe\'re especially excited about getting back to our roots in Guild Wars. We\'re planning on playing Alliance Battles, one of our favorite game-modes of all time. We\'ll be the ones running around shouting \"HAMSTORM!!!\" like fools in all chat. There are kids in candy stores less excited than we are to be Hamstorming again.\r\nWhat plans have you got for keeping everyone motivated for the full 24 hours?\r\n\r\nWe\'ll be changing up what we\'re doing and who we\'re playing with often, so I\'m hoping that will keep us on our toes. Also energy drinks. And maybe showers. I hear showers help.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about Relics of Orr at their <a href=\"http://www.relicsoforr.com/\">website</a> or by following them on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/relicsoforr\">twitter</a>.','Meet Our Healers: Relics of Orr','','inherit','closed','open','','8-revision-v1','','','2014-11-17 23:59:19','2014-11-17 23:59:19','',8,'http://www.healingovertime.org/2014/11/8-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(152,1,'2014-11-18 00:00:21','2014-11-18 00:00:21','Today we had the honor of chatting to <a href=\"http://booncontrol.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BOON Control</a> about the creation of Healing Over Time and what they were hoping to bring to the table for the event. Acina the GM of their World of Warcraft guild answered our questions:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.healingovertime.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/boon_control.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-143\" src=\"http://www.healingovertime.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/boon_control-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"boon_control\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<em>\"BOON Control is an EU gaming community that has evolved over the years from a PvP raid guild in 2005, to the multi-game focus it has today. Over the years we have made a name for ourselves in PvP/RvR based games, most notably in Aion where we were a driving force on our server, this grit and determination to be the best transferred to Guild Wars 2 where again we strived to be the best. In 2013 a small contingent returned to WoW, initially with no intent, but we\'re not able to do things by halves. Currently we are progressing through Heroic level content, with an eye on Mystic raiding and server firsts in Warlords of Dreanor. As well as WoW we have a guild ready for Elder Scrolls online, WildStar and members can be found in a plethora of other online games. Why not pop by and say hello, we don\'t bite!\"</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How were you introduced to Healing Over Time?</strong></h5>\r\nWe met up with Tasha and several other members of Mystic Spiral at gamescom 2013, one evening we talked about MYSTathon and how we could make it bigger. A few months later we had a fully fleshed out plan to have 6/7 guilds work together to raise money for Child\'s Play. Here we are today, ready and waiting!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What do you hope your group will get out of participating in the event?</strong></h5>\r\nWe as a group are looking to have fun for 24 hours, laugh at each other\'s early morning mistakes and raise a heap of money for Child\'s Play.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How many people from your group are you hoping will take part?</strong></h5>\r\nWe will have 12 people playing full-time for the 24 hours with a roughly the same again helping part-time. As with the other guilds, we are looking to highlight three streams on the Healing Over Time website. We plan to have a hardcore Diablo 3 faceoff between two of our streams as well as a variety of other games being played on the third.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What is going to make your group different?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are quite a reclusive guild; one of our main rules is that members are encouraged to avoid public forums etc, in part due to being a PvP guild and part of that community, how it tends to be rife with drama. I fully expect things to start off slow but as we get further in, people will get chattier.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What in jokes does your guild have? Can you tell us the stories behind them?</strong></h5>\r\nHonestly most of them cannot be publicised, one thing you may notice is there will be much use of the word \"thingy\". The main source will be Tvar and oddly enough everyone will generally understand what it has been substituted for, even when there are thingies strung together to make a full sentence. Other than that, I fully expect the guild to be on their best behaviour!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?</strong></h5>\r\nIndividually we have been in many charity events over the years, members get involved as often as they can. This will be the first year we have taken part in something as a guild.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?</strong></h5>\r\nPersonally, I am looking forward to not dying in hardcore Diablo 3.

Similarly, the Dragon Season guild is international with members from many different countries. Our vision is to be a place where everybody feels welcome and a part of the Dragon Season family. We are mainly found in Guild Wars 2 (and 1!), but as is common for gamers, we play a variety of games and also have a tiny child guild in Rift.\"</em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How were you introduced to Healing Over Time?</strong></h5>\r\nSam, the lead organizer of Healing over Time has been a friend of mine for quite a while now. Dragon Season always had a close relationship with her guild \"Mystic Spiral\" and tried to assist them with their ongoing projects on way or another. I guess that\'s the reason we are part of this charity event. Our sole purpose is to help others and we are here to actively show our support.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What do you hope your group will get out of participating in the event?</strong></h5>\r\nWe don\'t hope to gain something personal out of our participation in Healing over Time. Our only hope would be for this event to be successful and help those in need.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How many people from your group are you hoping will take part?</strong></h5>\r\nAs much as we\'d like to stream for the event, it seems like our internet connections won\'t allow us to do so. The generous organizers of Healing over Time though have allowed us to contribute by taking on some other tasks like chat moderation, to ensure that everything will progress rather smoothly on that front, or by joining the streamers in game during the event.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What is going to make your group different?</strong></h5>\r\nWe like having fun. So, if we were to compete with the rest of the guilds, within the boundaries of good sportsmanship, that would be our motivation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What in-jokes does your guild have?</strong></h5>\r\nWe don\'t have injokes. But we have people that are fun to have around and there\'s often laughter involved when they\'re there.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?</strong></h5>\r\nQuite often I\'d say. We tend to get involved in <a href=\"http://pinkday.gamergivingback.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pink Day in LA</a> and the <a href=\"http://pinkday.gamergivingback.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MS Toga party</a> for multiple sclerosis each year, both organized by <a href=\"http://pinkday.gamergivingback.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gamer\'s Giving Back.</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?</strong></h5>\r\nYou\'ll find us in games like Guild Wars 2, Rift, Torchlight 2, Team Fortress 2 and League of Legends if everything goes according to plan.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What plans have you got for keeping everyone motivated for the full 24 hours?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are quite used to living life to the fullest, so I don\'t that think either fatigue or lack of motivation will be that much of a problem.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you\'d like to discover more about Dragon Season and what else they\'re getting up to send them a tweet <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/DragonSeasonCom\" target=\"_blank\">@DragonSeasonCom</a> or visit their <a href=\"http://www.dragonseason.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.','Meet Our Healers: Dragon Season','','inherit','closed','open','','109-revision-v1','','','2014-11-18 00:00:34','2014-11-18 00:00:34','',109,'http://www.healingovertime.org/2014/11/109-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(154,1,'2014-11-18 00:02:44','2014-11-18 00:02:44','We caught up with our second guild - <a href=\"http://www.afterlife-gaming.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Afterlife</a> - to talk to Ed Orr (aka Screenager) about what they were hoping to achieve during Healing Over Time.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.healingovertime.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/afterlife.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-136\" src=\"http://www.healingovertime.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/afterlife.jpg\" alt=\"afterlife\" width=\"266\" height=\"187\" /></a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"Afterlife are an EU gaming community established in 2009, focused primarily on the PvP element of gaming. In Aion we started out as a small band of PvP focused players never willing to give up or to give in and determined to play the game the way we wanted to play it. This struck a chord with other players and in time we have grown from less than 20 players to having hundreds of members playing in multiple guilds across several games. Afterlife has gained its name among the MMO community by performance on the highest level in several MMO’s including but not limited to: AION, AoC, LOTRO, SW:TOR and Guild Wars 2. At this time we have active guilds in both Guild Wars 2 and Aion, with community events running at least once a month and a player base that are never going to turn away from a fight.\"</em></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How were you introduced to Healing Over Time?</strong></h5>\r\nI was introduced to Healing over Time by the fantastic work of Mystic Spiral last year. We saw the fantastic work that Sam and the guild did and when I found out it was coming round once more I jumped on the chance to get involved.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out not only is HoT a fantastic event with a great team behind it but it is now being carried to even greater things by our fellow streamers. There are guilds like Boon Control, Enigma, Mystic Spiral, Relics of Orr and the Viking King all getting involved. Not only is it set to be tons of fun but Afterlife have had interaction with pretty much every guild involved in HoT in the past. What more could you ask from a charity event but good games, great people and lots of friends. Possibly lots of donations for the kids?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What do you hope your group will get out of participating in the event?</strong></h5>\r\nHonestly we hope that we get to have a great time and anything we make for charity is worth the effort. Every shiny denomination of your unit of currency counts. The donation widget cannot accept goats, chickens or skritt shiny!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How many people from your group are you hoping will take part?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are contributing two full time 24 hour streamers. We expect the guild to drop in and out throughout the day but we haven’t had any hard and fast additional streamers mostly due to technical reasons or shyness on camera. Still we will leave a swathe of death, destruction and empty coffee cups behind us!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What is going to make your group different?</strong></h5>\r\nWe are looking to be a gap bridge between a number of our other streamers. A number of the groups involved are heavily centred around Guild Wars 2 or Wildstar. We’ve got interest with guilds active across a number of games and we will be popping up across most of the games. Expect to see us dropping in on the other streamers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>How frequently does your guild get involved in charitable events?</strong></h5>\r\nWe do try to run some sort of charitable event on an annual basis even if it is just to get rid of all the swag we build up. Last year we had one person stream for 24 hours and made a few hundred pounds for charity. If every streamer for HoT makes this we should smash the target for this years HoT!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What games are you particularly looking forward to playing and why?</strong></h5>\r\nI\'m just looking forward to having an excuse to go to WvW with my guild on stream. It\'s been far too long since we brought the stream out and got the wider community involved in the game. If chat is busy enough we might even let them drive!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h5><strong>What plans have you got for keeping everyone motivated for the full 24 hours?</strong></h5>\r\nI will be using excessive amounts of coffee! Also from my experience you need to play something that you really, really enjoy and isn’t too cerebral during hours 17-20ish - you don’t want to flake out on the audience.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfterlife can be reached through their <a href=\"http://www.afterlife-gaming.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> or <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/afterlifelegion\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> if you’d like to know more about the group and the many games they’re involved with.
